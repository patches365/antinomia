	The Colosseum allows a duel between two opponents. Unfortunately, you can't give commands to your character. It is randomly chosen by the game engine. The algorithm which choose the commands doesn't consider their usefulness.
	This patch skips the automatic selection of commands for the character. With Umaro's exception, you can freely choose the commands for your character in the Colosseum.

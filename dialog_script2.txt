Biggs: So that's the town?<D$18><EOP>
Wedge: Hard to believe an Esper's been found frozen there, 1000 years after the War of the Magi_<D$18>

[caption #1]
Biggs: Think it's just another hoax?
Wedge: Maybe_ <EOP>
But if they've sent HER along with us, this might be the real deal. <D$18>

[caption #2]
Biggs: This woman who was born with magical powers_<D$18><EOP>
I heard she fried 50 of our Magitek Armored soldiers in under 3 minutes.<D$18>

[caption #3]
Wedge: Not to worry. The Slave Crown on her head robs her of all conscious thought. She'll follow orders.<D$18>

[caption #4]
Wedge: We'll approach from the east.
Move out!<D$0C>

[caption #5]
 Long ago, the War of the Magi
     reduced the world to a
scorched wasteland, and magic
     simply ceased to exist. <E$FF><OP$12>

[caption #6]
1000 years have passed_ Iron,
gunpowder, and steam engines
  have been rediscovered, and
     high technology reigns_ <E$FF><OP$12>

[caption #7]
    But there are some who
  would enslave the world by
reviving the dread destructive
    force known as [magic.] <E$FF><OP$12>

[caption #8]
        Can it be that those
  in power are on the verge of
       repeating a senseless
        and deadly mistake? <E$2A><OP$12>

[caption #9]
An eerie glow surrounds you.<EOP>
Want info about Save Points?
 <C> Yes
 <C> No

[caption #10]
Wedge: Let's put her on point.
No sense taking any risks.
Forward!

[caption #11]
Wedge: The Esper's gotta be in here.
Move out!

[caption #12]
Guard: Imperial Magitek Armor?
Not even Narshe's safe anymore!

[caption #13]
Guard: Machine-riding,
self-important swine!
Take this!

[caption #14]
Guard: Narshe's freedom depends on us!

[caption #15]
Wedge: According to our source, the frozen Esper was found in a new mine shaft.
_Maybe this one_

[caption #16]
Biggs: I'll handle this.
Stand back!

[caption #17]
Guard: We've got 'em trapped, now!

[caption #18]
Guard: We must defend the mines!

[caption #19]
Locked.

[caption #20]
Girl: Where am I_?

[caption #21]
Old Man: Whoa!
And I only just removed the crown!
<EOP>
Girl: _head_hurts_

[caption #22]
Old Man: Easy! This is a Slave Crown. The others had complete control over you while you were wearing it.

[caption #23]
Girl: I can't remember a thing_
Old Man: Don't worry.
It'll all come back to you_in time, that is.<EOP>
___

[caption #24]
My name_
_is_<A0>_<EOP>
Old Man: Impressive!
You've got a strong spirit to reclaim even that much of yourself so fast.

[caption #25]
Soldier: Open up!
Hand over the girl with the Magitek Armor!

[caption #26]
Soldier: Open this door!
We want that girl!
She's an officer of the Empire!

[caption #27]
<A0>: Empire_?
Magitek Armor_?

[caption #28]
Old Man: Look,
I have to get you out of here!
They're not going to listen to reason.

[caption #29]
Old Man: Over here!

[caption #30]
A mysterious young woman, controlled by the Empire, and born with the gift of magic__

[caption #31]

Please enter a name.

[caption #32]
Old Man: You should be able to escape through the mines out back.  I'll hold them off here.  Hurry!

[caption #33]
Got her!

[caption #34]
She's up there!

[caption #35]
Kefka: My sweet little magic 
user_! Uweee, he, he! With this Slave Crown I'll practically OWN you!!

[caption #36]
Kefka: What's taking so long?!  Why hasn't the squad I sent to Narshe reported back yet? <E$08><OP$12>

[caption #37]
Kefka: Where's my magic user?!
Where's my Esper?!

[caption #38]
Cid: This is my finest work.
These Magitek converters combine the power of magic with machines_

[caption #39]
Gestahl: With our new-found power, nothing can stand in our way!<EOP>
Hurrah!!!
Long live Emperor Gestahl!!!

[caption #40]
Old Man: Took you long enough!
How goes the robbing and plundering trade?

[caption #41]
<A1>: I PREFER the term treasure hunting!<EOP>
Old Man: Ha!
Semantic nonsense!
<A1>: There's a HUGE difference!

[caption #42]
<A1>: Anyway, were you the one who sent for me?<EOP>
Old Man: Yeah.
There's a girl I'd like you to meet.

[caption #43]
<A1>: You mean the girl with the magical powers?

[caption #44]
Old Man: The town's guard is pursuing her even as we speak.<EOP>
I know this town is capable of resisting the Empire.<EOP>
But our pride in our own self-sufficiency has prevented us from joining the Returners, the underground resistance.<EOP>
Even if I try to explain that the girl was only being controlled by the Empire, they won't listen_

[caption #45]
<A1>: All right_
I think we'd better help her_

[caption #46]
Old Man: Agreed.
Make your way first to Figaro, and talk to the king.

[caption #47]
Treasure hunter and trail-worn traveler, searching the world over for relics of the past_

[caption #48]
Guard: Now we gotcha!

Need more information?
<C> Yes
<C> No

[caption #54]
You'll fight using 3 different groups. Press the Y Button to switch between them.<EOP>
Your job is to defeat the commander of the guards before his men reach <A0>. Save her, or else_

[caption #55]
<A0>: Unh_

[caption #56]
<A1>: Thanks, Moogles!
We're in your debt!

[caption #61]

[caption #62]
<A0>: A man said my memory would come back_<EOP>
<A1>: Your memories_ _<D>
Don't worry, I swear I'll protect you!!
<A0>: ???<EOP>
<A1>: I won't leave you until your memory returns!!<EOP>
By the way, this secret entrance might be useful some day.
Don't forget about it!

[caption #63]
Man: You mean, THIS young woman_?!

[caption #64]
<A0>: Who_are you?

[caption #65]
Man: Oh, my apologies!

[caption #66]
Man: How rude of me to turn my back to a lady!

[caption #67]
The young king of Figaro Castle, ally to the Empire, and a master designer of machinery_

[caption #68]
<A4>: I am <A4>, King of Figaro.

[caption #69]
<A1>: Surprised someone like me knows a king?

[caption #70]
<A1>: Talk to you later!

[caption #71]
<A4>: So_you're an Imperial soldier! No problem. Figaro and the Gestahlian Empire are allies!<EOP>
Please, relax while you're here.
It's not in my blood to harm a lady.

[caption #72]
<A0>: Why are you putting so much effort into helping me?
Is it because of my_abilities?

[caption #73]
<A4>: I'll give you 3 reasons:
First of all, your beauty has captivated me!<EOP>
Second_I'm dying to know if I'm your type_

[caption #74]
I guess your_abilities_would be a distant 3rd.

[caption #75]
<A0>: __? <D>
What does that mean?

[caption #76]
<A4>: Guess my technique's getting a bit rusty_

[caption #77]
<A4>: Come find me when you feel rested.

[caption #78]
<A0>: I see_I suppose a normal girl would have felt something from those words. <D>
But I'm hardly_normal_

[caption #79]
Feel free to wander about.

[caption #80]
Go see the King!

[caption #81]
Weapons and items manufactured here are sent to South Figaro.

[caption #82]
I've read that long ago, people were able to use a power called [magic].<EOP>
People who used magic were called [mages].

[caption #83]
Scholars the world over are doing research on magic.
Even though there's no such thing_

[caption #84]
Ancient texts I'm studying speak of a [1000 year-old city beneath the sand.]<EOP>
I wonder what this means, <EOP>
[_when the queen stands and takes 5 steps_]

[caption #85]
I heard the Empire is using something called [magic]_

[caption #86]
The Empire has smashed the 3 cities on the southern continent. Just a matter of time 'til they come up here_

[caption #87]
Gestahl has harnessed the power of magic.
Guess he's gonna conquer the world or something now.

[caption #88]
<A4> loves women of all kinds.  Young or old, if you're female he'll put the moves on you.

[caption #89]
His highness said he'd marry me when I get older!

[caption #90]
I'm gonna marry the king!

[caption #91]
He recently tried to hit on the high priestess_
Surely, he's_talked to you?

Ah! King <A4>!

Error.
Contact a supervisor.
From: Development Team.

[caption #96]
These thieves have been
terrorizing the vicinity.
Stay away from 'em!

[caption #97]
I demand to see <A4>!
How dare they keep us in this stinking pit!

[caption #98]
Phew! _Hey, do you think I stink?

[caption #99]
Relax, they're just blowing off steam. But I'm telling you, there's no sense keeping us here!<EOP>
We're just small potatos compared to the real threat lurking out there! And King <A4> knows it!

[caption #100]
I'm Lone Wolf, the pickpocket!

[caption #101]
Matron: <A4>'s at it again!? He hits on anything that moves!

[caption #102]
Matron: <A4> has a twin brother. He was such a nice boy, always thinking of his family_

[caption #103]
Youth: Brother,
What's wrong with father?
What's all this talk of his successor?<EOP>
<A4>: Are you blind?
Look how thin his face has become!

[caption #104]
Youth: ?__What is it?

[caption #105]
Youth: Brother!

[caption #106]
Youth: Tears__?!

[caption #107]
<A4>'s twin brother, who traded the throne for his own freedom_

[caption #108]
Matron: Yes_
His name is <A5>. I'm sure he's grown into a fine man by now.<EOP>
He was so small and meek compared to <A4> when he left.
I wonder what he's like now?

[caption #109]
Chancellor: The whole business of the succession was so repugnant to <A5>, the King's brother, that__<EOP>
__he fled the castle forever. The succession was settled with a coin toss_

[caption #110]
Merchant: I can't take money from the King!<EOP>
<A4>: Look, don't you have a family?
Don't worry about it and just take it.

[caption #111]
Merchant: Sir <A5>, I can't take your money!<EOP>
<A5>: Take it!
Haven't you heard? My brother says I'm a notorious spendthrift!

[caption #112]
<A4>: I hear you've already overthrown the three southern nations.
So what brings you here?<EOP>
Trooper: That's for us to know!

[caption #113]
Sir Kefka!?
What on earth do_<EOP>
Kefka: Outta my way!

[caption #114]
<A4>: Well?
How do you like my castle?

[caption #115]
King <A4>!
Someone from the Empire to see you!

[caption #116]
<A4>: Probably Kefka!

[caption #117]
Kefka: Phooey!
Emperor Gestahl's stupid orders!

[caption #118]
Kefka: <A4>, you pinhead!
Why do you have to live in the middle of nowhere?<EOP>
When I said I wanted the girl back, I didn't mean I wanted to trudge out here PERSONALLY!<EOP>
My body isn't built for this kind of grunt work.

[caption #119]
Kefka: Ahem_there's SAND on my boots!

[caption #120]
Soldiers: Yes, Sir!
All set, Sir!

[caption #121]
Kefka: Idiots!

[caption #122]
<A4>: I thought we were allies! What are you doing in my domain?<EOP>
Trooper: Allies? The Empire and this back-water, two-bit kingdom?!

[caption #123]
<A4>: What brings Kefka, court mage of Emperor Gestahl, into our lowly presence?<EOP>
Kefka: A girl of no importance recently escaped from us. We heard she found refuge here_

[caption #124]
<A4>: Hmm_this wouldn't have anything to do with this [witch] everyone's been whispering about, would it?<EOP>
Kefka: Lies!
She_merely stole something of minor value.
Is she here?

[caption #125]
<A4>: That's a tough one!

[caption #126]
<A4>: You see, there're more girls here than grains of sand out there. I can't keep track of 'em all!<EOP>
Kefka: I'd hate to be you if we find out you're lying_
Mwa, ha!

[caption #127]
Kefka: I truly hope nothing happens to your precious Figaro_!

[caption #128]
<A1>: I'd say that guy's missing a few buttons_
<A4>: _
Where's <A0>?

[caption #129]
<A4>: Take her to her room_

[caption #130]
<A4>: I'd love to chat with you, but the Chancellor and I must plan our strategy.<EOP>
Sometimes I hate being a king!
If you'll excuse me.

[caption #131]
<A1>: Follow me.

[caption #132]
<A1>: Sorry if we've made you think we only have a business interest in you.  I'm_<EOP>
<A0>: You're <A1>, right? <A4> told me about you.
Is it true you're a thief?

[caption #133]
<A1>: That's TREASURE HUNTER!

[caption #134]
<A1>: On the surface, <A4> pretends to support the Empire.<EOP>
The truth is, he's collaborating with the Returners, an organization opposed to the Empire.<EOP>
I am his contact with that group_

[caption #135]
<A1>: The old man you met in Narshe is one of us.<EOP>
<A0>: Empire_but I'm a soldier of the Empire_!

[caption #136]
<A1>: Not anymore!
You were only being controlled by them.
Things are different now.

[caption #137]
<A0>: I don't understand_
What should I do?
My head_hurts_

[caption #138]
<A1>: What you do from here is up to you.<EOP>
You haven't had much time to think about it yet.
But I'm sure you'll find your way eventually_

[caption #139]
<A0>: Up to me_<D>
But_how do I decide?

[caption #140]
<A4>: _?<EOP>
What the_?!

[caption #141]
<A4>: What's happening?<EOP>
Soldier: It's the Empire!
It's Kefka!

[caption #142]
<A4>: What are you doing?

[caption #143]
Kefka: Bring me the girl. Now!
<A4>: I told you she's not here!<EOP>
Kefka: Then_
welcome to my barbecue!!
Uwa ha ha ha!

[caption #144]
FIRE!!!

Fire! Fire! Heh, heh heh_

[caption #146]
<A4>: Do it like we planned_<EOP>
Soldier: Yes, Sir!

[caption #147]
Kefka: Changed your mind_?

[caption #148]
<A4>: I guess I have no choice_

[caption #149]
<A4>: Or maybe I do!

[caption #150]
Kefka: Oh my!
It appears Good King <A4> is valiantly abandoning his kingdom!<EOP>
How utterly delightful!

[caption #151]
<A4>: Jump! <E$04><OP$12>

[caption #152]
<A1>: Yahoooo!

Kefka: Go!! GET THEM!

Kefka: Son of a submariner!
They'll pay for this_

<A1>: This is great! <E$06><OP$12>

[caption #160]
<A0>: Were those_bad people?<E$04><OP$12>
I_ <D>I'm scared_

[caption #161]
<A4>: <A0>,
there's someone I'd like you to meet_!

[caption #162]
<A1>: We're members of a resistance organization called the Returners.<EOP>
<A4>: Our mentor, Banon, would certainly like to meet you.<EOP>
[Magic] is going to be the key to winning this war.

[caption #163]
<A0>: [Magic]_

[caption #164]
<A4>: <A0> has magical powers. That Esper seemed to_react to her. Can there be some connection?<EOP>
<A0>: I haven't the foggiest! It just seems natural to me that I have the use of this power_

[caption #165]
<A4>: But no HUMAN is born with the powers you seem to have, and_

[caption #166]
<A4>: I apologize.
<A0>: What should I do_?<EOP>
<A4>: I'm sure the Empire is after you and the secrets to your powers_<EOP>
If they get their hands on you again, the world's finished_<EOP>
<A0>, you want to understand your own powers, right?

[caption #167]
<A4>: That's why I'd like to consult with Banon and shed some light on this.<EOP>
<A0>: __

[caption #168]
<A1>: Please_

[caption #169]
<A4>: OK!
To the south there's a cave that leads to South Figaro.

[caption #170]
This cave leads to South Figaro. However, I cannot let you through at this time.

[caption #171]
Soldier: King <A4>!
Where are you headed?<EOP>
<A4>: Through the cave, and eastward to South Figaro, then north to the Returner hideout.<EOP>
<A4>: Return to the castle, and tell the others we're safe.<EOP>
Soldier: Yes, Sir!
Take care!

Welcome to South Figaro!

[caption #179]
You'll find lots of excellent weapons, armor and relics in our shops.

[caption #180]
Did you hear?
Figaro Castle sank into the sand!<EOP>
You couldn't find it even if you knew where to look!

[caption #181]
Mt. Kolts is to the east.

[caption #182]
Beyond Mt. Kolts you'll find the Sabre mountain range.

[caption #183]
Equip relics to gain a variety of abilities!<EOP>
These double my walking speed!

[caption #184]
My husband, Duncan, is a
world-famous martial artist!<EOP>
He's taking his disciples to
Mt. Kolts for meditation and training.

[caption #185]
<A5>, where's Vargas?
Where's my husband?

[caption #186]
<A5>: Master is gone_
It was Vargas_

[caption #187]
Duncan's Wife: Why would Vargas do such a thing_<EOP>
Fortunately, my husband taught his most secret techniques to you.

[caption #188]
<A5>: For 10 years you've treated me like a son. I am eternally grateful!

[caption #189]
_.

[caption #190]
<A1>: At the very least you could give me a response_

[caption #191]
<A4>: Stand back!
He seems vaguely familiar_
Wait a minute_!

[caption #192]
He owes allegiance to no one. 
Not a soul has seen the true
face behind his mask_

[caption #193]
<A4>: That's <A3>_!
He'd slit his mama's throat for a nickel!
He's a ruthless assassin.

[caption #194]
<A1>: We should steer clear of him, just to be safe.

[caption #195]
<A3>: Leave us.
The dog eats strangers_

[caption #196]
The guy at the counter_
He's kinda creepy_

[caption #197]
That guy at the counter_HEY! Where'd he go?

[caption #198]
One of Duncan's students looks a lot like you.

[caption #199]
So Duncan's dead.  That's too bad.

[caption #200]
Duncan trained his son, Vargas, in the martial arts, but he complained he wasn't progressing fast enough.

[caption #201]
The house in the northern part of town belongs to our wealthiest citizen.

[caption #202]
The Empire's been invading one town after the next.
We're not safe here!

[caption #203]
Figaro castle turned on the Empire?!<EOP>
Aw man, I don't want to get dragged into the war, too.

[caption #204]
Oh, that's just great,
we've made an enemy of the Empire now_

[caption #205]
This town's defenses are solid!
Even with their Magitek Armor, the Empire won't be able to invade that easily.

[caption #206]
Attack from the east.
That way, <D>__?!<EOP>
Oh! Wh, what do you want? How rude of you to barge in while I'm trying to write a letter!

[caption #207]
Ahem_
Naturally, I am the wealthiest man in this town.

[caption #208]
Oh, what have I done?!
How could I be so tempted by money that I'd pass intel to the Empire?

[caption #209]
Chung chung_
Chung chung_
Magitek Armor!!!!

[caption #210]
My Dad's VERY important so lots of famous people have dinner with him.  Not too long ago even General <A10>_ <D>_<EOP>
Uh, I, uh, just made that up!

[caption #211]
Wind the clock!
Wind the clock!<EOP>
Uh, that was just a jump-rope rhyme!

[caption #212]
Has war really begun?
I'd better return home_

[caption #213]
The Imperial Troops have turned this house into their headquarters.

[caption #214]
There's always a nasty draft in this room. Where's it coming from?

[caption #215]
I don't like strangers.
Bring me some cider, and maybe I'll talk to you.

[caption #216]
What?!
No cider?!

[caption #217]
Hurumph_DOG!

[caption #218]
Ah! Cider!
Glug, glug, _<EOP>
Huh? Secret passage?
Well, there is one that leads to the rich man's house.

[caption #219]
Go downstairs and give my grandson the password. It's_uh, umm_
I forget!

[caption #220]
My grandfather was a servant for the rich family at the north end of town.

[caption #221]
Only people dressed as merchants may pass through.

[caption #222]
Merchant, right?
You may proceed.

[caption #223]
The password is_
<C>[Rose bud]
<C>[Courage]
<C>[Failure]

[caption #224]
You're an Imperial spy!
Can't fool me!

[caption #225]
Secret entrance.

[caption #226]
Good luck!

[caption #227]
Outta the way!
I gotta get this cider over to the old man!
That's my job!<EOP>
Now scram!

[caption #228]
I'm off work.
Get lost!

[caption #229]
Are kids allowed in here?
<D>__What do you think?<EOP>
Oh, all right_

[caption #230]
Hey you!
Come to steal my cider?

[caption #231]
You thief!

[caption #232]
Took the old man's cider!

[caption #233]
The ship isn't going anywhere.

[caption #234]
Imperial troops are milling about.
Gotta jam without being seen!

[caption #235]
Use caution.

[caption #236]
<A4>: Hm_
What's that smell_?

[caption #237]
<A4>: Flowers_
His favorite_

[caption #238]
<A4>: And this_
His favorite tea_

[caption #239]
<A4>: These dishes!
They were his favorite!

[caption #240]
<A4>: <A5>_he was_here?!

[caption #241]
<A4>: Excuse me_

[caption #242]
<A4>: Do you know the man who lives here?

[caption #243]
Man: Of course. He left a couple of days ago after he heard Master Duncan was slain.
He headed into the mountains.<EOP>
I heard Duncan's son, Vargas, is missing as well.
I have a bad feeling about this_

[caption #244]
<A4>: So <A5> was Duncan's student_
To think he's been in the care of someone so renowned_

[caption #245]
Scum!
You're Returners!

[caption #246]
Is that you, <A5>?

[caption #247]
Vargas: So you're with <A5>, huh?

[caption #248]
<A1>: Who're YOU?

[caption #249]
<A1>: Were you the one sneaking around before?
Vargas: Who cares?!

[caption #250]
<A0>: It was you, wasn't it? The student who killed Master Duncan and fled.

[caption #251]
Vargas: Hmph, it's not like the likes of you could take me in.<EOP>
You're going to rue the day you ran into me!!

[caption #252]
<A4>: <A5>?
Is he here?

[caption #253]
<A4>: <A5>!!!

[caption #254]
<A5>: Big brother?

[caption #255]
<A1>: This is your... LITTLE brother?!

[caption #256]
<A0>: [Little]_brother?
I was sure he was one of Vargas's bears_

[caption #257]
<A5>: Bear?!

[caption #258]
<A5>: Bear, huh? I like the sound of that!

[caption #259]
<A5>: Anyway, brother, what are you doing here?
<A4>: We're on the way to the Sabre Mountains.<EOP>
<A5>: To the Returner hideout, no doubt?

[caption #260]
<A5>: So things are finally starting to happen! I've been secretly watching things from afar.<EOP>
I was afraid Figaro was going to turn into an Imperial puppet state.

[caption #261]
<A4>: Our time to strike back has arrived.<EOP>
I can tell the old advisors are sick of going along with the Empire, too.

[caption #262]
<A5>: Think a [bear] like me could help you in your fight?

[caption #263]
<A4>: You'd_join us?
<A5>_!!

[caption #264]
<A5>: I think Duncan would rest easier if he knew his disciple played a part in bringing peace to the world.

[caption #265]
<A1>: Let's get going!

[caption #266]
King <A4>!
This way, please!

[caption #267]
Did you speak with Banon?

[caption #268]
Not even the Empire'd think of looking here for us!

[caption #269]
Aha!

[caption #270]
Welcome!

[caption #271]
Thank you!

[caption #275]
Banon: So is this the girl who reacted to the frozen Esper?
<A0>: Esper_?<EOP>
<A4>: Seemed the Empire had complete control over her.

[caption #276]
Banon: Carrier pigeons brought word that she wiped out 50 of the Empire's best soldiers in a few minutes.

[caption #277]
<A0>: I didn't_!!

[caption #278]
<A1>: <A0>!
<A4>: Master Banon, don't be so harsh!

[caption #279]
Banon: Don't deny it!

[caption #280]
<A4>: Master Banon!
We brought the girl with us.

[caption #281]
Banon: Perhaps you've heard this story? Once, when people were pure and innocent,<EOP>
there was a box they were told never to open. But one man went and opened it anyway.<EOP>
He unleashed all the evils of the world: envy_ <D>greed_ <D>pride_ <D>violence_ <D>control_<EOP>
All that was left in the box was a single ray of light: Hope.

[caption #282]
<A0>: __
Banon: Whatever might have happened, don't think of your own abilities as a curse_<EOP>
And you are that last ray of light, our only hope_

[caption #283]
<A4>: Master Banon!

[caption #284]
Banon: I'm so tired_
Let me rest a while.

[caption #285]

We're a small organization now, but our membership is starting to soar.

[caption #290]
Banon: <A0>_
Talk to everyone here, heed their advice.

[caption #291]
Master Banon?
He went outside a moment ago.

[caption #292]
Welcome back!
Glad you're okay.

[caption #293]
Welcome back!

[caption #294]
Is Master Banon well?

[caption #295]
My wounds are healing.

[caption #296]
The Empire is wiping out Returners everywhere.
We have to discover some means of fighting back, or_

[caption #297]
<A1>: The Empire took away someone precious to me. I've hated the Empire ever since_<EOP>
As long as the Empire continues to do as it pleases, it'll just create more people like me.<EOP>
That's why I joined the Returners.

[caption #298]
Someone dropped a scrap of paper_<EOP>
<C> Toss it in the trash.
<C> Leave it there.

[caption #299]
Banon: Who did this?
Who left this piece of paper here?

[caption #300]
<A0>: But_I don't have anyone I consider [precious]_<EOP>
<A1>: That's not entirely true.<EOP>
On the contrary, I'm sure there's someone who considers YOU precious! So do it for them_

[caption #301]
<A4>: I know it's selfish of us to ask for your help_<EOP>
If we force you, we're no different than the Empire_<EOP>
So we want you to make up your own mind.

[caption #302]
<A5>: I don't really understand what's going on_but I do know my brother is always right.<EOP>
He's always looked out for me. You can trust him, <A0>_

[caption #303]
But don't you DARE tell him I said that!

[caption #304]
Banon: Have you made a decision?<EOP>
Will you become our last ray of hope?
<C> Yes
<C> No

[caption #305]
Banon: You will? Really!!

[caption #306]
<A0>: But_ <D>
I'm scared_

[caption #307]
Banon: I see_

[caption #308]
Banon: I thought as much_

[caption #309]
Banon: You're sure about this?

[caption #310]
I understand your unease.
But even as we speak, innocent lives are being lost_<EOP>
Please. We need your abilities.
This relic will keep you safe.<EOP>

     Received [Genji Glove]!

[caption #311]
We truly need your help!

[caption #312]
Please join us in our battle!

[caption #313]
Banon: The person who possesses this relic need not fear harm.

[caption #314]
Banon: Please, <A0>_
I'd like you to take it with you.

[caption #315]
<A0>: What is this??? <D>

[caption #316]
Banon: If everyone works together we'll be successful.
Never give up hope!

[caption #317]
Banon: A lucky charm. Take it!<EOP>

     Received [Gauntlet]!

[caption #318]
Banon: I have a plan!
Please get everyone together!

[caption #319]
<A0>: Hope_
How can anyone put their hope in me?

S_South Figaro_

[caption #321]
What? WHAT IS IT?

[caption #322]
Banon: What's going on?
What happened?

[caption #323]
<A0>: He's badly wounded!

[caption #324]
Banon: Someone did a number on him_

[caption #325]
E_Empire_took South Figaro_
Coming_this way_unnnh_

[caption #326]
Banon: They've found us_
We haven't a moment to lose!

[caption #327]
<A4>: <A1>!<EOP>
<A1>: I know_
[Someone] has to sneak into South Figaro and slow the Empire down, right?<EOP>
<A4>: This's right up your alley! Good luck!

[caption #328]
<A1>: <A0>_
Please wait for me_
And_please_<EOP>
_don't let a lecherous young king, who shall remain nameless, near you!
<A4>: <A1>!!!

[caption #329]
<A5>: Big brother_
Aren't you EVER going to grow up?

[caption #330]
Banon: What're we going to do?<EOP>
<A4>: We'll escape down the Lete River, and make our way to Narshe. I want to see that Esper for myself_<EOP>
Banon: Right. There's a raft by the back entrance.
It's a gamble, but we're fresh out of options_

[caption #331]
<A4>: You're in danger here. Come with us to Narshe.<EOP>
It'll probably even be a good opportunity for you to understand your abilities_

[caption #332]
Banon: We've no time to dilly-dally. Let's make for Narshe!

[caption #333]
We'll handle things here_
Please leave for Narshe!

[caption #334]
Please take care of Master Banon.

[caption #335]
The Lete River runs through some underground caverns.

[caption #336]
Banon: We all know that the Empire is using Magitek power in battle.<EOP>
What we don't know is how Gestahl has managed to resurrect magic. That's the main point.

[caption #337]
<A4>: I had <A1> look into the rumor that the Empire is forcing the world's finest scholars to study Espers.

[caption #338]
<A1>: The attack on Narshe was over an Esper, too_

[caption #339]
Banon: Right_

[caption #340]
<A0>: You mean there's some connection between Espers and Magitek?<EOP>
Banon: I can only recall one thing linking Espers with Magitek power_

[caption #341]
<A4>: You don't mean_<EOP>
Banon: Indeed!
The ancient War of the Magi_

[caption #342]
[No!]
[It can't be!]

[caption #343]
<A1>: My Grandma used to tell me stories about magical machines_
Could they have been true?

[caption #344]
<A4>: Could that ancient tragedy be playing out once again_<EOP>
Banon: It's hard to say. That all happened 1000 years ago.<EOP>
But historical studies have provided a number of conflicting and frightening theories_<EOP>
According to one theory, humans and machines were infused with powers drained from Espers_

[caption #345]
<A0>: Is that what Magitek power is_?

[caption #346]
<A4>: We can only fight Magitek enemies with Magitek weapons_<EOP>
Banon: No! Then we would only repeat the mistakes of the War of the Magi!
<A4>: Then what do we do?<EOP>
Banon: I was thinking perhaps we could talk to the Esper_
<A1>: Talk to it?!

[caption #347]
Banon: It's risky, but if we have <A0> react with that Esper once again, it might just wake up_<EOP>
<A4>: I wonder if that's wise_?

[caption #348]
Banon: I'm not saying it's a certainty.
Regardless,
we need <A0>'s help.

[caption #349]
<A1>: <A0>_

[caption #350]
<A0>: I'll give it a try!<EOP>
<A5>: This all went in one ear and out the other, but I'm in! Sounds fun!

[caption #351]
Emergency!
Master Banon_

[caption #352]
Banon: What? <D>
What's that noise?

[caption #353]
Uwaaaa!
The Empire's invading!

This raft'll take us to Narshe!

Hop aboard the raft?
<C> Yes
<C> No

[caption #359]
Fleeing the Empire's troops,
Banon, <A4> and <A0> ride the rapids toward Narshe.
But the going won't be easy_

[caption #360]
Head toward Narshe, but protect Banon at all costs.<EOP>
If Banon falls in battle, your journey's over.

[caption #361]
Which way?
    <C> (Straight)

 <C> (Left)      <C> (Right)

Gotta get to Narshe on the fly_

[caption #370]
<A1> has worked hard to stymie the efforts of the Imperial troops. But now he desperately needs to escape_

[caption #371]
Halt!

[caption #372]
<A1>: Ouch!!
I gotta steal me some new clothes, fast!!

[caption #373]
Back inside!

[caption #374]
Gotta get moving!
The attack on Narshe is imminent. Who knows when they'll give the order?

[caption #375]
Imperial soldiers are pigs!
Green Suits live to brawl_

[caption #376]
<A1>: I've seen her before_
Of course! She's one of the Empire's generals!

[caption #377]
Groomed by the Empire as a
Magitek Knight, none have seen 
the woman behind the general_

[caption #378]
Guard: This's what happens to traitors!

[caption #379]
Guard: So even the mighty General <A6> has fallen.

[caption #380]
<A6>: Not as far as the likes of you who prefer to bully innocent civilians_
Guard: Hold your tongue!

[caption #381]
<A6>: Isn't it true Kefka is planning to poison the people of Doma, to the east?
Guard: Shuddap!

[caption #382]
Guard: Hmph. You're getting the axe tomorrow, anyway. Run your mouth while you still can.

[caption #383]
Keep a close eye on her!

[caption #384]
Yes, Sir!
I can go for days without sleep!

[caption #385]
<C> (Remove her chains?)
<C> (Just stand there and stare)

[caption #386]
<A6>: Aren't you a little short for a soldier?
<A1>: Huh? Oh, the uniform!

[caption #387]
<A6>: What do you hope to peddle down here?
<A1>: Oops! Forgot I was wearing these clothes.

[caption #388]
<A6>: And you are_

[caption #389]
<A1>: I'm with the Returners. Name's <A1>.<EOP>
<A6>: Returners!!! I see_
I am General <A6>_<EOP>
Or at least I was. Now I am nothing but a common traitor_

[caption #390]
<A1>: Let's go!
<A6>: !? You would take me with you?

[caption #391]
<A6>: No, it would be futile.
As you can see, I can barely walk as it is_

[caption #392]
<A6>: I am grateful, but_
Even if you were able to escape with me, it is unlikely you could protect me.<EOP>
It is better that I remain here and face my death with dignity.

[caption #393]
<A1>: I WILL protect you!

[caption #394]
<A1>: Trust me! You'll be fine!

[caption #395]
<A1>: Let's go!

[caption #396]
Soldier: _more soup_'n_

[caption #397]
Soldier: _'n some bread, too_
<D>Mumble <D> Mumble_

[caption #398]
<A6>: Wait.

[caption #399]
<A6>: This soldier may carry something to aid our escape_

[caption #400]
<A6>: Why are you helping me?
<A1>: You remind me of someone_

[caption #401]
<A1>: No, it's nothing.
I just want to, okay?!

[caption #402]
<A6>: This passage leads out.

[caption #403]
<A1>: Huh?
<A6>: Something is emerging from the wall!!

[caption #404]
<A1>: Whew!!!
Looks like we're in the clear!

[caption #405]
<A1>: What IS that noise?

[caption #406]
I hear the lady general betrayed the Empire and got locked up!<EOP>
Now with no one in charge here, we can do whatever we want!

[caption #407]
Oh crap!
It's my shift to guard the passage under the northern mansion.<EOP>
Eh, whatever. I'm already this late, a little more won't hurt.

[caption #408]
I heard there are 2 secret tunnels under the rich man's house.<EOP>
One leads out of town, the other to one of these houses_

[caption #409]
Thanks to our informer, this town fell instantly!

[caption #410]
Rascals!
Knock it off!

[caption #411]
<C>(Take off the disguise?)
<C>(But I like these clothes.)

[caption #412]
Lower ranking soldiers are weak but like to brawl.<EOP>
They leave themselves so wide open you could steal the clothes off their backs.

[caption #413]
Hmph!

[caption #414]
Avoid the armored soldiers! They'll kill you just for talking to them!

[caption #415]
Hey, lady_didn't you just bust in here wearing Magitek armor?

[caption #416]
Banon: Please wait!

[caption #417]
Get out of here!
If you don't_

[caption #418]
<A4>: Hold on.
I'm King <A4> of Figaro_
Guard: Liar!!!

[caption #419]

<A4>: This is why I hate dealing with men.
He won't even listen!<EOP>
<A0>: I'm sorry, it's because of me_

[caption #420]
Arvis: Master Banon! King <A4>!
_and <A0>!!!

[caption #421]
Banon: Arvis!
What's happening here in Narshe?<EOP>
Arvis: The town won't side with the Empire or the Returners.
They just won't listen.<EOP>
But with you and the King of Figaro here, then maybe_

[caption #422]
<A4>: First, how are your people doing?<EOP>
Arvis: They're pretty anxious about that Esper in the mines.

[caption #423]
Banon: We believe this young woman is capable of giving us some answers about that Esper.<EOP>
Arvis: The people are naturally curious about it as well.<EOP>
Depending on how we handle this, they may become more accepting of <A0>_

[caption #424]
<A4>: That Esper is either going to save us_or dig us an early grave_

[caption #425]
<A0>: When <A1> first helped me, he fiddled with something right around here.

[caption #426]
<A4>: He told me. Twist this outcropping here and_

[caption #427]
<A4>: Goodness_
<A0>: What's that_?<EOP>
<A4>: I heard there was a place where applicants for the city guard had their strength tested. This must be it_<EOP>
If we follow that light we should reach the other side safely.<EOP>
If we become surrounded, we need to [tag] the red light in order to proceed_

Soldier A: Shhhh!
Do I always have to tell you to keep it down?!
You're hopeless_!<EOP>
Soldier A: Sometimes I feel like General <A10> is the only thing keeping us from becoming Kefka's disposable pawns. <EOP>
I really hope nothing happens to him.
Soldier B: Yeah, no kidding.

[caption #481]
<A5>: What the_?
Where'd these soldiers come from?

This's an Imperial base.
Too many soldiers_

[caption #486]
Soldier A: Hey, have you heard?
Soldier B: Oh, you mean_<EOP>
Soldier A: Shhh! Quiet down.
If Kefka catches us, we're toast.

[caption #487]
Soldier A: It seems like Kefka is trying to drive General <A10> out of the army and make himself a general.<EOP>
Soldier B: Don't even joke about that!
If that happens, I'm outta here. <EOP>
I don't want to end up like one of those poor saps he had his witch fry.

Soldier A: Yes, Sir.
You are Lord Kefka, correct?
How are you today, Sir?<EOP>
Kefka: Please!
Save your petty small talk!<EOP>
If you can't even handle lookout duty, I can find [other] uses for you!

[caption #491]
Soldier B: Hmph!
Who'd ever follow orders from the likes of you?!<EOP>
Soldier B: _One of these days I'm gonna force-feed that guy the dirt off the bottom of General <A10>'s boots.

[caption #492]
Soldier: General <A10>.
I'm sorry to report that the Commander has fallen_

[caption #493]
<A10>: _Call off the attack.
There will be no more lives sacrificed today.

[caption #494]
Soldier: But, General!
I'm ready to lay my life down at any time for the Empire!

[caption #495]
<A10>: You're from Maranda, right?<EOP>
Soldier: Y_yes Sir. Why?

[caption #496]
<A10>: And you have family there? Are you asking that I travel to your home and present them your effects?<EOP>
What would I say to them?
How could I even face them?<EOP>
You're a human being before you're a soldier. Don't be so eager to throw your life away.<EOP>
I'm sure Emperor Gestahl feels the same.

[caption #497]
Soldier: Yes, Sir!

[caption #498]

You've been trying to conquer Doma for three years now and what do you have to show for it?!

[caption #516]
<A10>: This is a delicate operation, Kefka.<EOP>
Doma is an ancient country rich in history and culture.
It would be a travesty to destroy it.

[caption #517]
Kefka: That's right, you go be the hero and plead for the sake of a traitor.<EOP>
I'm sure that'll earn you a gold star on your spotless record.

[caption #518]

Soldier: But, General <A10> said_<EOP>
Kefka: He's no longer here!
I'm in charge now. Hand it over!<EOP>
Soldier: Some of our people are prisoners inside the castle!
If they drink the water_<EOP>
Kefka: Who cares?!
We have no need for people who are stupid enough to get captured!

Kefka: Tch, noisy brat!

While he was off base, there was a plot to poison the Doman water supply. I couldn't do it. I ran_<EOP>
Imperial loyalist soldiers chased me, beat me, and left me for dead_ Now I can barely move_<EOP>
At this rate I doubt I'll ever see Lola's face again_<EOP>

Flowers are blooming in the garden, telling me spring is here.<EOP>

We're an island isolated from the rest of the continent.
You can only get here by boat.<EOP>
By the way_
What does [isolated] mean?

Usually you can get here by following the coast from the north, but right now it's blocked by a rockslide.

Hurry and go help <A0>!

Pshaw! What nonsense!

Narshe is a neutral city.
We want no war here.
But that accursed Empire still_

Wait, Figaro Castle can dive under the sand and travel west to Kohlingen?
Neat!

Only one of them is locked. Now what do ya suppose is inside_?!

A glowing form soared off toward Figaro Castle.
It seemed almost_human.

Curse the day we dug up that Esper! That's what brought the Empire here!

Looks like war's a'comin'!

There's a sasquatch that lives inside the mine_or so I heard.

Lone Wolf, the infamous thief, has been sighted here.
Are my treasures safe?

[caption #928]
Weapon and Armor shops are selling some new stuff for the coming war.

[caption #929]
Maybe we could borrow the Esper's power_ 
Would that even work_?

No one believes me, though_

King <A4>!
Welcome back!

[caption #936]
Gotta admit, seeing Kefka embarrassed like that brought a smile to my face.

[caption #937]
That girl blazing in light flew off past the mountains west of the desert.

[caption #938]
Who'd have thought a person could fly over a mountain range?

[caption #939]
This castle's greatest accomplishment is its ability to move freely across the desert.<EOP>
As long as there's a desert there, it can even move beyond the mountains.

[caption #940]
Wanna get past the mountains?
This castle can't fly, but it can submerge! Find the person in charge of the Engine Room!

[caption #941]
Our alliance with the Empire has been nullified.

_<A0>?? __Oh my_

[caption #1081]
Ramuh: Her life is not in danger. She is simply unable to control herself after using a power she's unaccustomed to.<EOP>
I am Ramuh. The Esper Ramuh.

[caption #1082]
Esper!?

[caption #1083]
[But don't Espers live in another world?]

[caption #1084]
<A6>: But don't Espers live in another world?

[caption #1085]
<A11>: Esper_ live in different world_ right?

[caption #1086]
Ramuh: That doesn't mean we can't live in this world, too. Espers come in a multitude of forms.<EOP>
My form is similar to a human's, so I am able to live here. I need not worry about being recognized as an Esper.

[caption #1087]
[Why would you hide the fact that you're an Esper?]

[caption #1088]
<A11>: Why you no say you Esper?

[caption #1089]
Ramuh: Humans and Espers are incompatible.

[caption #1090]
<A1>: But my grandma told me that Espers and people once lived side by side!<EOP>
Was that just a fairy tale?

[caption #1091]
[But my mother once told me that Espers and people once lived side by side.

[caption #1092]
I heard that Espers and people once lived side by side.
Was that just a fairy tale_?

[caption #1093]
<A11>: <A11> hear story. People and Esper live together long time ago.

[caption #1094]
Ramuh: Ha ha, that was no fairy tale. That was true.
We started out as friends.<EOP>
That was before the War of the Magi_

[caption #1095]
War of the Magi_

[caption #1096]
Ramuh: It took place_long ago. Espers fought humans who were infused with magical power extracted from Espers_

[caption #1097]
After that meaningless struggle, the Espers, fearing their powers would be used again, crafted their own world.<EOP>
They moved there and shut the humans out. It was a world only for Espers.

[caption #1098]
That was until one day 20 years ago when humans stumbled into it. Humans who knew of Espers and Magitek.<E$18><OP$12>

[caption #1099]
Thus began a hunt for Espers. Gestahl extracted magic from those Espers and created his invincible army. <E$18><OP$12>

[caption #1100]
When they recognized this, the Espers constructed a giant gateway and expelled the humans from their world.

[caption #1101]
Ramuh: Even now, Espers who were captured back then are being held in the Empire's Magitek Research Facility_<EOP>
_being drained of their powers_
I fled here to avoid a similar fate.

[caption #1102]
Ramuh: Looks like she's calmed down a little.

[caption #1103]
Ramuh: When I sensed <A0>'s power destabilize, I called her here. She responded to my magical summon.

[caption #1104]
[<A0>'s_an Esper?]

[caption #1105]
Ramuh: No, she's a bit different from us_

[caption #1106]
[<A0> looks like she's in pain.]<EOP>
Ramuh: She harbors anxiety about the nature of her very existence.<EOP>
Her pain is a manifestation of that.

[caption #1107]
[Is there any way we can help her?]

[caption #1108]
Ramuh: When she is able to fully accept herself, her anxiety will likely be quelled.

[caption #1109]
[What should we do_?]<EOP>
Ramuh: I believe one of my brethren being held in Gestahl's Magitek Research Facility can help her.

[caption #1110]
[If we go to the Magitek Research Facility, you're sure we'll find your people?]

[caption #1111]
<A6>: Huh? The Magitek Research Facility?
Your people_ are in there?

[caption #1112]
<A11>: Magitek Research Facility_?
Your people_ there?

[caption #1113]
<A6>: The Magitek Research Facility_
That place_

[caption #1114]
Ramuh: I abandoned my brethren, escaping here and living in hiding alone.
Even still, I haven't much time.

[caption #1115]
[What do you mean?]

[caption #1116]
Ramuh: Gestahl's methods are incorrect. Draining an Esper of its power by force results in imperfect magic.<EOP>
True magic is only obtained when the Esper becomes Magicite_

[caption #1117]
[Becomes what?!]<EOP>
Ramuh: When we will ourselves to become Magicite, we can bestow you with our power.
[Magicite_?!]<EOP>
Ramuh: When an Esper dies, its power remains in this world as Magicite_
[?!]

[caption #1118]
Ramuh: These are my comrades who fell while escaping the Empire. And I will give you my power, as well_

[caption #1119]
[Why would you go this far_?]

[caption #1120]
Ramuh: If you make use of our power, you can reverse this planet's descent into death_<EOP>
You must stop them. The War of the Magi must never be repeated_

[caption #1121]

Everyone here?
I was thinking, _<EOP>
<A4>: Let's talk on the way back.

[caption #1137]
<A4>: The Empire's trying to drain magic from Espers_ <E$10><OP$12>

[caption #1138]
<A5>: This can't be true_
<A6>_? <E$10><OP$12>

[caption #1139]
<A6>: I don't remember because they put us to sleep when they gave us the Magitek infusion.<EOP>
But I've heard rumors to that effect.

[caption #1140]
<A2>: Then we shall infiltrate the Empire.<EOP>
<A4>: We'd best split into 2 groups.
We still need to beef up our defenses in Narshe.

[caption #1141]
<A2>: Indeed.

[caption #1142]
<A6>: I'll go to the Empire. You'll need someone with inside knowledge_<EOP>
<A5>: But alone_?

[caption #1143]
<A1>: Don't worry, I'll go with her.

[caption #1144]
<A6>: <A1>!

[caption #1145]
<A2>: Should thou perhaps take a few others?

[caption #1146]
<A1>: Please wait for us in Narshe. We'll find our way back safely.<EOP>
[If you wish to change group members, head for Narshe.]

[caption #1147]
<A3>: There's no need for me to remain with you.

[caption #1148]
<A6>: Having decided that, the Empire is on the continent to the south. No boats go there_<EOP>
<A1>: The people of Jidoor, a town to the south, probably have a way. They're rich, after all.

[caption #1149]
<A6>: <A1>.<EOP>
<A1>: Yeah?
<A6>: Why are you coming with me?

[caption #1150]
<A1>: Well_
There's talk of a legendary treasure there.<EOP>
I just want to have a peek around the Empire to see what I can turn up.

[caption #1151]
These days you can't just go to the Imperial continent on a whim.

[caption #1152]
If you want to get to the Southern Continent, the only way is by air.<EOP>
How to fly? Is that a serious question?
By airship, of course!

[caption #1153]
There's currently only one airship in the entire world, and it's owned by a gambler.<EOP>
Though I suppose he's more like a sky pirate.

[caption #1154]
The gambler likes flashy shows. He's always at the opera. I think he likes the beautiful divas_

[caption #1155]
You're the spittin' image of Maria! Huh? Haven't heard of her? She's a famous opera singer!

[caption #1156]
Impresario: Maria!?

[caption #1157]
<A6>: Are you talking to me?

[caption #1158]
Impresario: Sorry_my mistake.
You just bear more than a passing resemblance to our beloved diva_
Ohh_what to do_

[caption #1159]
<A6> looks just like Maria_?

[caption #1160]
That guy dropped this.

[caption #1161]

He's been drinking himself senseless since that letter arrived_

[caption #1162]
<A1>: Who's this [Wandering_]? what's-his-name?<EOP>
Master: You born on a farm, son?

[caption #1163]
That's <A9>, owner of the world's only airship.

Impresario: Ah! You again!

[caption #1170]
<A1>: I read that letter.
<A9>'s coming to abduct her, right?<EOP>
Impresario: He'll probably appear right at the climax of Scene 1. He loves an entrance_

[caption #1171]
<A1>: Right!
If we could only grab him then_!

[caption #1172]
Impresario: Dear me, NO!
You'll ruin the performance!
I'll lose my job!

[caption #1173]
<A6>: Then you're history!<EOP>
Impresario: This is simply horrid! I want the performance to be a success!<EOP>
But I don't want Maria to be abducted_!

[caption #1174]
<A1>: We'll let him grab her_

[caption #1175]
<A1>: We'll use a decoy. We purposely let him grab her, then follow after him.<EOP>
If we're lucky, we'll be able to commandeer his airship.

[caption #1176]
Impresario: Are you mad?!!
If something should happen to Maria_

[caption #1177]
<A1>: That's why the decoy! We'll hide Maria somewhere safe!<EOP>
Impresario: Come again?

[caption #1178]
<A1>: You said SHE looks like Maria, right?

[caption #1179]
<A6>: Now just a minute_

[caption #1180]
<A1>: We'll dress <A6> up as Maria and let her be abducted, then she'll let us onto the airship!

Might as well make the most of this. MUSIC!!

Stage Master: Impresario's orders, huh?
Hit the switch on the far right.
Don't touch any of the others.

Stage Master: Don't press the wrong switch, or you'll be in a world of pain.

Stage Master: The door in the room to the left of the stage should be open now.<EOP>
You can reach the rafters from there.

You're, you're not the real Maria, are you?!

[caption #1270]
<A6>: <A9>, we need your help. We have to go to Vector. We need this ship to get there.

[caption #1271]
<A9>: Look, if you're not Maria, I have no business with you.

[caption #1272]
<A6>: Wait! <D>
We were told your ship is the finest vessel in the world.

[caption #1273]
<A1>: And that you were the world's most notorious gambler_

[caption #1274]
<A4>: I'm the King of Figaro. If you cooperate, you'll be well rewarded_

[caption #1275]
<A5>: My brother's the King of Figaro. Cooperate, and I'll ask him to reward you.

[caption #1276]
<A2>: I am a warrior of Doma. This request comes from me as well.

[caption #1277]
<A9>: Come here.

[caption #1278]
<A6>: So_ <D><EOP>
<A9>: Don't misunderstand me. I'm still not sure if I'm going to help you.

[caption #1279]
<A9>: Hmph_
Thanks to the Empire, my business has basically dried up.

[caption #1280]
<A6>: It's not only you. There are many cities and towns under Imperial occupation.

[caption #1281]
<A1>: The Empire is abusing Magitek power to enslave the world.

[caption #1282]
<A4>: The Empire and my realm were allies_
until recently.

[caption #1283]
<A5>: There's no way we'll bow to the Empire's wishes!

[caption #1284]
<A2>: _I lost my friends_
and my family.

[caption #1285]
<A9>: The Empire <D>_huh.

[caption #1286]
<A6>: You're in the same boat as us in your disdain for the Empire. That's why_<EOP>
<A9>: You know_you're even more stunning than Maria.
<A6>: ????

[caption #1287]
<A9>: All right, I've made up my mind!<EOP>
<A6> will marry me, then I'll help you.
Those are my conditions.

[caption #1288]
<A1>: WHAT!
You can't just decide that on your own!

[caption #1289]
<A6>: Fine by me.

[caption #1290]
<A9>: Yes! It's settled!

[caption #1291]
<A6>: But I have conditions_

[caption #1292]
We'll decide with a coin toss.<EOP>
If it's heads, you'll help us. If it's tails, I'll marry you.
Well, Mr. Gambler_?

[caption #1293]
<A9>: Oho! Fine!
I accept!

[caption #1294]
<A1>: Are you all right with this, <A6>?
Becoming his wife just like that_?

[caption #1295]
<A2>: That man uses people_

[caption #1296]
<A6>: Ready?

[caption #1297]
<A6>: I win!
Now, honor your part of the bargain!

[caption #1298]
<A9>: How_unusual!
This is the first I've seen a two-headed coin.

[caption #1299]
<A6>: I think you've been hustled, Mr. Gambler.

[caption #1300]
<A9>: Ha!
How low can you get?!
I love it!<EOP>
All right, I'll help you.
Gambling my life against the Empire_<EOP>

<A1>: This unwieldy-looking ship really moves! Could it crash?

[caption #1307]
<A9>: When things fall, they fall. <D>Life itself is just a series of wagers until you bust_

[caption #1308]
<A1>: This ship will be way too conspicuous in Imperial airspace. <EOP>
We need to land some distance away so they don't spot us.<EOP>
<A9>: Right.
I'll wait on board in case of an emergency.

[caption #1309]
<A9>: What's up?
The Empire too scary for you?

[caption #1310]
<A9>: I'll have to repair the airship. Go check what's happening in the Empire.

[caption #1311]
<A9>: Repairs aren't finished yet. You'd better take the boat from Albrook.

That guy Kefka? He was Cid's first experimental Magitek Knight.<EOP>
But the technique wasn't perfected yet, so he obtained abnormal magical powers, <EOP>

What happened?

Cid: This is a disaster!
Your fighting has caused the capsules to rupture! It's too dangerous here!

[caption #1402]
Cid: Quick! Over here!

[caption #1403]
Cid: Even though Kefka has been keeping me in line with threats, I still did such terrible things_

[caption #1404]
Cid: The life-energy of those Espers_

[caption #1405]
Cid: Meeting you has helped me come to a decision. I'm going to talk to the Emperor and have this stupid war stopped!

Cid: <A6>_
I've known her since she was a baby. I raised her as if she was my own daughter!<EOP>
But the whole time she was also being groomed as a Magitek Knight, and has done some awful things.<EOP>
If I ever see her again, I want to apologize_
for everything I've done_

[caption #1407]
Cid: No! It's Kefka!

Kefka: Crud!
What a mess!!

Let's get outta here!

You won't get away!

Maduin: Hello...?
Hang in there...<EOP>
What should I do?
<C>(Take her back with you?)
<C>(Leave her here?)

[caption #1425]
She's pretty weak.
Better let her rest for a moment.

[caption #1426]
Elder: You say there's a human?<EOP>
Maduin: She likely_
made some error in judgement and wandered in from the other side.

[caption #1427]
Elder: This evening is an ill omen_

[caption #1428]
You okay, Maduin?

[caption #1429]
You'd better kill her right away. Humans and Espers are incompatible_

[caption #1430]
You're the Gate Keeper, Maduin?

[caption #1431]
Everyone here's feeling uneasy.

[caption #1432]
You've wanted to take a peek into the human world beyond the gate up north, huh, Maduin?

[caption #1433]
Why'd you bring that thing here?

[caption #1434]
Strong winds_
Be careful, Maduin.

[caption #1435]
The barrier between our worlds has surely weakened over the past 1000 years.

[caption #1436]
You okay Maduin?

[caption #1437]
Do you even know what you've done?

[caption #1438]
Elder's orders_
No one passes through the gate.

[caption #1439]
Emergency!
Something's coming through the gate!

[caption #1440]
They say a human girl's here_

[caption #1443]
Maduin: Did I awaken you?

[caption #1444]
Girl: You're_an Esper?
What's this pendant on my neck?

[caption #1445]
Maduin: It's my gift to you.
It's an Esper World charm.<EOP>
Girl: Esper World_
I really DID get lost.<EOP>
Maduin: The Esper folk are pretty uneasy, you being a human and all_<EOP>
Girl: You the one who_saved me?

[caption #1446]
Madeline: My name is Madeline.
The human world has degraded.<EOP>
I hated how it had become swirling with hatred and greed, so I wandered into a storm and somehow ended up_

[caption #1447]
Maduin: Are humans and Espers
truly_so different?

[caption #1448]
Madeline: So I guess I'm considered [evil] in this world, too_
Maduin: No, I mean_

[caption #1449]
Madeline: I'll return to the human world tomorrow.
Maduin: You'll need a guide.

[caption #1450]
Elder: Are you all right with this?
That human already left.

[caption #1451]
If the humans knew of the Espers' power_
And they sought to use it_<EOP>
That would doom us all.

[caption #1452]
If you're looking for the human girl, she went to the gate between the human and Esper world a while ago.

[caption #1453]
But no human has ever wandered in here in centuries, so why now?

[caption #1454]
Youth: What's wrong, Maduin?

[caption #1455]
Maduin: If you don't want to return to your world, you may stay here.<EOP>
Madeline: But humans and Espers can never coexist_!

[caption #1456]
Maduin: How do we know for sure unless we observe for ourselves?

[caption #1457]

    How do we know_

[caption #1458]

        unless we_

[caption #1459]

   observe for ourselves_?

[caption #1460]
Maduin: We've given her a name_
Madeline: What?<EOP>
Maduin: It's <A0>.
It's a good name, right?

[caption #1461]

      2 years later_

[caption #1462]
Humans!!!!!
The barrier has weakened again. Just like that day of the storm 2 years ago_

[caption #1463]
But it's different from when Madeline came.
It's an army seeking our magic powers.

[caption #1464]
Blast it!
Retreat to the Elder's house!

[caption #1465]
Gestahl: Aha!
We've finally found it!<EOP>
Our search for the secret entrance to the Esper World spoken of in ancient texts has finally paid off!

[caption #1466]
Gestahl: Grab them!
Riches to any man who captures an Esper!
GO!

[caption #1467]
Elder: We've no choice_
I'd hoped we wouldn't have to resort to this, but_<EOP>
Maduin: You mean_
seal the gate?

[caption #1468]
It's dangerous out there!

[caption #1469]
Soon the humans will arrive!

[caption #1470]
Madeline: <A0>'s all right.

[caption #1471]
Elder: Here's the plan. We'll cause a tempest that'll sweep all the nasty creatures out of our realm.<EOP>
Then we place a seal on the gate. This spell can only be performed by Espers of a particular bloodline.<EOP>
I am the only one left who can do it.

[caption #1472]
Maduin: But in your state, you might just_<EOP>
Elder: I will likely die.
But with my death, the sealed gate shall never open again.<EOP>
Maduin: Are you all right with that, Madeline?

[caption #1473]
Madeline: I no longer bear any attachment to the other side.

[caption #1474]
Elder: Let's do it.
We have no other choice.

[caption #1475]
Esper: This is all because of that human girl!<EOP>
Maduin: Nonsense!<EOP>
Esper: I'm sure she led them to us.

[caption #1476]
Maduin: Get a grip on yourself!<EOP>
Esper: No! She's one of them!
Soon she'll be wearing our hide!

[caption #1477]
Maduin: Oh no!

[caption #1478]
Madeline took <A0> to the gate!

[caption #1479]
Elder: It's dangerous! Where are you going? _ Urghh_
Maduin: It's Madeline!<EOP>
Elder: Impossible!
It's too late! I've already begun casting the barrier. You won't be able to come back!<EOP>
Maduin: I don't care!

That's where I got my powers_<EOP>
I'm all right now. I should be able to control my power, at least for short periods of time_

[caption #1492]
<A4>: So Gestahl must've known the secret of the Espers' power back then.<EOP>
<A1>: And those Espers at the facility were grabbed during that expedition!<EOP>
That means <A6>'s power came__
at the expense of an Esper_

My son's been forced to serve in the Empire's army. I do hope he comes home safely_

When peace was reached, the soldiers left our town.

The Imperial troopers are gone! Let's dance! Let's sing!

[caption #1554]
I was forced into the Empire's army. They made me do some awful things_

[caption #1555]
I feel a little down_

[caption #1556]
Most of the town's youths were led off to serve as Imperial troopers.

[caption #1557]
Our poor kids'll be back soon, won't they?

[caption #1558]
There's huge gate deep inside a cave to the east. I heard about it from my grandfather.

[caption #1559]
Time to put Tzen back together!

[caption #1560]
Our royal family was slaughtered by the Empire.

[caption #1561]
Thanks to you people peace has been achieved!

Some friendly advice! There's a weapon called the Guardian.
It can't move, but it's very powerful. Run, if you meet it!

This is the port city of Albrook. We've been occupied by the Empire_

[caption #1579]
Business is picking up in the port! Maybe economy will make a recovery!

[caption #1580]
How could an island float in the sky?!

[caption #1581]
They say there's something important to the east_
The Empire built a base there, and no one may enter.

[caption #1582]
I heard some monsters flew out of the mountain beyond the base and attacked the Empire!

[caption #1583]
Yeah, thanks to that flying island, this town was shrouded in darkness!

[caption #1584]
We have to bribe the troopers to do business here_
*sob*

[caption #1585]
We've got nothing to sell to Imperials! <D>
_Ahh, I've wanted to say that for a long time.

[caption #1586]
The shoe's on the other foot now_
*sob*

[caption #1587]
People are disappearing from the Empire_?
And now there's that floating island_
I've got a ba~ad feeling about this_

[caption #1588]
Vector, capital of the Empire, is at the center of this continent.

[caption #1589]
You'll find some good weapons and items in Tzen and Maranda.

[caption #1590]
Some strange guy's tryin' to sell glowing stones_
When I wouldn't take one, he said he was going to Tzen.

[caption #1591]
I'm a scholar of magic. Monsters on this continent are weak to magic.

[caption #1592]
I found this in a 1000 year-old text:
8 dragons seal away this awesome beast.<EOP>
Its name is Crusader_
Defeat these dragons, and its power can be released_

[caption #1593]
I'm a scholar of weapons. 1000 years ago, during the War of the Magi, 2 so-called Ultima Weapons existed.<EOP>
One changed a person's power into a sword, the other was an monster, bred for mass destruction.

No entry into the port!

[caption #1595]
Ah_welcome!

[caption #1596]
Hey_you're not of the Empire!
Get outta here!

In any case, you're probably broke!

Ahaaa!!
Whooopie!

[caption #1599]
Look out if you're caught working with the Returners.

[caption #1600]
Now maybe we can get on with our lives.

[caption #1601]
I heard that Espers attacked the Empire_

[caption #1602]
All's well!

[caption #1603]
Is the war really over_?

[caption #1604]
Damn it_
These Imperial soldiers just do whatever they please.

[caption #1605]
This cafe is like an Imperial soldiers' dormitory!

Since the soldiers are leaving, business is bound to pick up. Oops_better keep my mouth shut.

Sure! No problem!

How 'bout it?

This way, please_

Banon: Oh, you're here!
The people of Narshe have finally decided to battle the Empire.<EOP>
How did it go at Vector_?

[caption #1613]
Arvis: I see_ <EOP>
We've worked out a plan to combine Narshe's resources with Figaro's technology to storm the Empire, but_<EOP>
we likely don't have sufficient manpower_

[caption #1614]
Banon: Perhaps all we can do is open the Sealed Gate_

[caption #1615]
<A0>: To the Esper World_?

[caption #1616]
Arvis: There's no way to defeat the Empire without their help.

[caption #1617]
Banon: If we open the Sealed Gate, which lies to the east of the Empire, the Espers can attack from there.<EOP>
Meanwhile, we can attack from the north.

[caption #1618]
Banon: But that's only if we can persuade the Espers to join our cause_<EOP>
We must re-forge the bond between Espers and humans.
And the only one who can is_

[caption #1619]
Humans and Espers_
If such a bond was impossible
then I wouldn't even exist__

[caption #1620]
<A0>_

[caption #1621]
<A0>: I'll do it.
I'm the only one who can!

[caption #1622]
<A0>!?

[caption #1623]
So it's to be an attack on two fronts.

[caption #1624]
Narshe's Elder: So the time to fight the Empire has finally come_
I suppose it was inevitable_

[caption #1625]
Banon: Get the Espers to understand, and we can bring this war to a screeching halt.<EOP>
<A0>_
I know you can do this_

[caption #1626]
Arvis: The Sealed Gate stands at the eastern edge of the Empire.<EOP>
There's a base there, but somehow we'll have to slip through_

[caption #1627]
<A1>: The Sealed Gate_
Can you sense anything, <A0>?

[caption #1628]
<A0>: __

[caption #1629]
<A1>: <A0>_

[caption #1630]
There's no negotiating with the Espers without <A0>_

but I'm afraid to do it alone__

[caption #1632]
That's odd_<EOP>
No Imperial soldiers_

      Chucked out_!

[caption #1657]
<A1>: I'm sure the Espers were headed for Vector_

[caption #1658]
<A2>: I shall never forgive the Empire for its crimes.

[caption #1659]
<A2>: I could feel the warrior spirits of those Espers!

[caption #1660]
<A3>: __
Why am I here_? <D>
For the money, I guess.

[caption #1661]
<A3>: I think Kefka's out for General <A10>'s hide!

[caption #1662]
<A4>: I'm not here goofing off, I'm planning our next strategy.

[caption #1663]
<A4>: Somehow we need to tap in to the power of those Espers_

[caption #1664]
<A5>: Let me at the Empire!

[caption #1665]
<A5>: Let's see what's become of the Empire! Hurry!

[caption #1666]
<A6>: I was one of the Empire's generals, but I still know evil when I see it.

[caption #1667]
<A6>: Kefka's sure to come up with another demented plan. We need to do something FAST!

[caption #1668]
<A7>: I was once a world-hopping adventurer, too, you know_

[caption #1669]
<A7>: I've lived a long time, but that's the first time I've fallen from so high.

[caption #1670]
<A8>: I know.
Let me draw their portraits!

[caption #1671]
<A8>: I'm sure those Espers are all very kind!

[caption #1672]
<A9>: The most precious things_?<EOP>
People who hold things too dearly aren't willing to wager them!

[caption #1673]
<A9>: Urghh!
For the time being, I don't own the skies_

[caption #1674]
Mog: Kupoppo!!

<A13>: Uhhhh_

[caption #1680]
<A0>: _the Espers_
were angry_

[caption #1681]
What happened?

[caption #1682]
The Espers flew off together_

[caption #1683]
Then, the Empire's citizens ran off, as though they were terrified.

[caption #1684]
Which way did the Espers go?

[caption #1685]
Toward the capital_

[caption #1686]

There's something under the ground_

[caption #1687]
Vector_

[caption #1688]
<A9>: We're almost at Vector.

[caption #1689]
There! What's that?

[caption #1690]
There's a switch inside.
What will you do?
<C> (Flick the switch.)
<C> (Leave it alone.)

[caption #1691]

    Heard a distant sound_

[caption #1692]
N_nuts!!! I thought I had the monopoly on the stuff buried around the bottom of that big stairwell_<EOP>
Digging around that open area would've landed me a treasure trove!

[caption #1693]

        Got [Inviz Edge.]

[caption #1694]

        Got [Super Ball.]

[caption #1701]
The Emperor's expecting you.
This way_

[caption #1702]
Emperor Gestahl awaits inside.

[caption #1703]
The Espers that emerged from the Sealed Gate came and laid waste to the Empire_<EOP>
The country's in ruins_

[caption #1704]
We've lost our will to fight.

[caption #1705]
When the Emperor learned of the atrocities that Kefka had committed, he threw him in prison.<EOP>
Looks like he'll be rotting there for the rest of his life.

[caption #1706]
The war's over_

[caption #1707]
The power of the Espers_
It's terrifying_

[caption #1708]
The Espers surely came to free their friends_

[caption #1709]
Peace at last_

[caption #1710]
The Magitek Research Facility's been dismantled.

[caption #1711]
You!?
How'd you get in here?

[caption #1712]
It sounds like the Emperor is open to talking peace with the Returners and other nations.

[caption #1713]
Kefka's been locked in the basement prison.<EOP>
Seems the Emperor found out that he used poison in order to capture Doma.

[caption #1714]
Kefka! Using poison_
how low can you get?!
I've always hated you!

[caption #1715]
Kefka: Hmph!
How DARE they put me in a place like this!
Graah!

[caption #1716]
Kefka: Inconceivable!!!

[caption #1717]
Kefka: What a bore.

[caption #1718]
Kefka's scum_
It serves him right!

[caption #1719]
The war was long and brutal_
I lost my entire family_

[caption #1720]
The war ended before we could use this machine_

[caption #1721]
Kefka's in jail!

[caption #1722]
Gestahl: I've lost my will to fight_

[caption #1723]
Cid: The Emperor's had a change of heart_

[caption #1724]
Cid!!

[caption #1725]
Cid: The Espers came to save their friends. When they learned the others had perished, they went berserk,<EOP>
and trashed the town_
Never will I forget their shrieks of rage_

[caption #1726]
Sentry: We have no more desire to fight. The war is over.

[caption #1727]
Gestahl: The power of those Espers_
Perhaps I had been naiive_<EOP>
If the Espers continue to run rampant they'll destroy the world. The Empire's power is infantile compared to them.<EOP>
We must find some way to negotiate with them and quell their anger.

[caption #1728]
Cid: This is something beyond the capability of a human_

[caption #1729]
Gestahl: Worthy warriors.
For tonight, let us dine together and open discussions.

[caption #1730]
Cid: There are some soldiers who still aren't too keen on peace.<EOP>
Please, before we dine, talk to as many soldiers as you can! Make them understand!

[caption #1731]
Dinner preparations underway.
One moment, please.

[caption #1732]
Trooper: Please talk to as many soldiers as you can. You have 4 minutes until dinner.

what should I paint_?

[caption #1750]
I finished the painting the Emperor requested_
It was a portrait of Gestahl himself.<EOP>
I put everything he wanted into it_ but it just wasn't meant to be_<EOP>
I sold it to Owzer, the rich man who lives in Jidoor.

That evening, the banquet
with the Emperor took place_

[caption #1767]
Trooper: This way, please.

[caption #1768]
Cid: I'll be sitting on the Returners' side this time.

[caption #1769]
Gestahl: Imagine!
All of us here together at the same table! First we must have a toast!

[caption #1770]
<C> To the Empire_
<C> To the Returners_
<C> To our hometowns_

[caption #1771]
Gestahl: Well then_
To our hometowns!

[caption #1772]
Gestahl: Well then_
To the Empire!

[caption #1773]
Gestahl: Well then_
To the Returners!

[caption #1774]
Gestahl: As you know, Kefka's in jail for the poisoning of Doma.
What shall we do with him?

[caption #1775]
<C> Leave him in jail_
<C> Pardon him_
<C> Execute him_

[caption #1776]
<A4>: Albrook's a port to the south of the Empire.<EOP>
The plan is to board a Magitek Armor freighter ship there and make for Crescent Island_<EOP>
We'll stay here and keep an eye on the Imperials.
You take care of the Espers.

[caption #1777]
<A5>: Can we really trust the Empire?! I have an awful feeling about this_

[caption #1778]
<A2>: Never will I be able to forgive Kefka_

[caption #1779]
<A11>: Smelly drinks here_
Smell like_ father_?

[caption #1780]
Mog: Kupo!

[caption #1781]
Emperor: General <A10> awaits in Albrook. Please accompany him to Crescent Island and look for the Espers_

[caption #1782]
Gestahl: Hmm_
Well, let's let him stew in his cell for a while. Then we'll decide what to do.

[caption #1783]
<C> Why'd you start the war?
<C> Why do you want peace now?
<C> Why'd we have to talk to 
      your men?

[caption #1784]
Gestahl: Everything that's happened was because of my lust for power.
I regret it all now_

[caption #1785]
Gestahl: I feel we need each other's help at this time_

[caption #1786]
Gestahl: Some of my men refuse to embrace peace. I felt they'd understand if they actually met you face to face.

[caption #1787]
Gestahl: With your permission, I'd like to talk about the Espers_

[caption #1788]
<C> One more question please!
<C> Okay.

[caption #1789]
<C> One more question please!
<C> Let's talk about Espers_

[caption #1790]
Gestahl: I assure you, I have answered your questions truthfully.

[caption #1791]
Gestahl: My Empire's been decimated by the Espers that emerged from the Sealed Gate.<EOP>
Their power is just too great. Unless we stop them, they might destroy the world_

[caption #1792]
<C> Yes, the Espers have gone
     too far.
<C> But you unleashed their
     power!!

[caption #1793]
Gestahl: When I saw the destruction the Espers had wrought on the Empire, my lust for power vanished.<EOP>
I asked myself why I had wanted that power in the first place.
And I had no answer_<EOP>
Even so, it doesn't undo all of the things I have already done_<EOP>
By the way_<EOP>
About those questions you asked me_
which did you ask first?

[caption #1794]
Gestahl: Right. Anyway, more than anything I want peace. That's my true dream. I want you to understand that!

[caption #1795]
Cid: You seem a bit tired.
Care for a rest break?

[caption #1796]
<C> Yes, let's take a break.
<C> Let's keep talking.

[caption #1797]
Shall we resume discussions?
<C> Yes
<C> No

[caption #1798]
Gestahl: Is there anything you wish to hear me say?

[caption #1799]
<C> That all you really want
     is peace.
<C> That your war's truly over.
<C> That you're sorry_

[caption #1800]
Gestahl: __

[caption #1801]
Cid: It would be wonderful if this led to peace_

[caption #1802]
Trooper: We want to test your strength!<EOP>
Won't you fight with us for a couple of minutes?
<C> Sure
<C> Sorry

[caption #1803]
Trooper: I see_

[caption #1804]
Gestahl: I understand.
My only dream in life is_peace! Now I must ask for a favor_

[caption #1805]
Gestahl: I understand.
I pledge that this war is over for good! Now I must ask for a favor_

[caption #1806]
Gestahl: I understand.
I'm truly sorry for what I've done! Now I must ask for a favor_

[caption #1807]
Gestahl: After they devastated my Empire, the Espers headed northward, toward Crescent Island.<EOP>
There is no telling when they'll go on the rampage again.
I would like to find them and begin mediation_<EOP>
But after everything the Empire has done to the Espers, I fear they would refuse to speak to us_<EOP>
That is why_ <D>
We need <A0>'s help.

[caption #1808]
Only <A0> can bridge the gap between Esper and human.

[caption #1809]
Gestahl: We must make for Crescent Island aboard the freighter from Albrook.<EOP>
Will you go along?
<C> Yes
<C> No

[caption #1810]
Gestahl: We cannot simply ignore the Espers!!<EOP>
Please_go along!
<C> Yes
<C> No

[caption #1811]
Gestahl: I'll have my finest general and his men accompany you!
General <A10>!

[caption #1812]
<A10>: I am General <A10>
A pleasure to meet you.

[caption #1813]
<A5>: Didn't I see him at Doma?
Yeah, he was the principled one.
So he's General <A10>_

[caption #1814]
<A10>: Is it you?! Sir <A2> of Doma? Please forgive me for not being there to stop Kefka from using poison_<EOP>
<A2>: __
That wasn't your fault.

[caption #1815]
<A10>: I shall await you in Albrook.

[caption #1816]
Gestahl: We must find the Espers and come to terms with them! You are our last hope!

[caption #1817]
<A1>: If <A0> goes, I'll go.

[caption #1818]
<A0>: <A1>_
Thank you_

[caption #1819]
<A1>: The rest of you wait here. I smell a rat_

[caption #1820]
<A4>: Agreed_
It's hard to trust the Emperor just like that_

[caption #1821]
<A2>: We'll stay here and investigate.

[caption #1822]
<A1>: Please do.
Leave no stone unturned!

[caption #1823]
<A4>: Right.
And you be careful!

[caption #1824]
Gestahl: I truly apologize about the poisoning of Doma.
No one dreamed Kefka would use poison.

[caption #1825]
<C> What's done is done_
<C> That was inexcusable.
<C> Apologize again!!

[caption #1826]
Gestahl: I'm so terribly sorry! Kefka's being severely punished, and we're cleaning up the poison.

[caption #1827]
Gestahl: By the way_
With regard to General <A6>_

[caption #1828]
<C> Was she an Imperial spy?
<C> <A6> is one of us!
<C> We trust <A6>!

[caption #1829]
Gestahl: Kefka was lying.
General <A6> realized the war was folly before anyone else.<EOP>
That's why she joined the Returners. Any other questions for me?

[caption #1912]
<A10>: Of course!

[caption #1913]
<A0>: But_
<D>I still don't know what it feels like to love_ <D>or be loved_

[caption #1914]
<A10>: You're just young. You only just recently have been able to begin exploring your emotions_ <EOP>
when those around you have had the benefit of many more years' worth of experience.<EOP>
Understand that it is not who you are but what was done to you that has caused this delay.<EOP>
Now that you are free, I'm sure in time you will come to understand_

[caption #1915]
<A0>: But_
<D>I want to know now_

[caption #1916]
<A0>: Who is it?

[caption #1917]
<A3>: Thought I'd sleep out under the stars.

[caption #1918]
<A0>: Did you hear_
<D>_what we were just talking about?

[caption #1919]
<A0>: So_

[caption #1920]
<A3>: I can't help you.
This is an answer you need to find yourself.

[caption #1921]
<A3>: I didn't mean to overhear anything.

[caption #1922]
<A3>: <A0>.

[caption #1923]
<A3>: In this world are many like me who've killed their emotions. Don't forget that.

[caption #1924]
<A10>: We're almost at Crescent Island. When we disembark, we'll split into two groups.<EOP>
<A6> and I will form one group. <A0>, you go with <A1> and <A3>.<EOP>
If you spot the Espers, report at once!

[caption #1925]
<A10>: <A0>, we can continue last night's conversation when we see each other again_

[caption #1926]
<A1>: Shall we get going?

[caption #1927]
<A6>: Um, I_

[caption #1928]
<A1>: Let's go.

[caption #1929]
Oh, wow!!!
Strangers!!

[caption #1930]
Mayor: Welcome, welcome!
<D>Magic_? What is this [magic]?

[caption #1931]
Mayor: No one is to divulge that we are able to use magic!

[caption #1932]
Use rods as items during battle for some amazing results!<EOP>
Only problem is they break after being used once!

[caption #1933]
Have you talked to old man <A7>? Do so, and the inn keeper may be more reasonable.

[caption #1934]
For some reason the inn keeper doesn't like strangers!

[caption #1935]
You're strangers_<EOP>
1500 GP if you wanna stay.
<C> (Well, okay.)
<C> (No way!)

[caption #1936]
Espers? What in blazes are they? If they're animals, talk to the old guy that lives on the edge of town.

[caption #1937]
Ha!
No admittance!

[caption #1938]
Old man <A7> looks like he's on his last legs, but he used to be a powerful warrior.

[caption #1939]
Have you met little <A8>? She loves to paint pictures! Wonder if she'd do my portrait?

[caption #1940]
Actually, <A8> isn't <A7>'s real grandchild.<EOP>
I heard she's his friend's daughter.

[caption #1941]
<A7> is a Blue Mage by training. He can memorize the attacks of monsters he has fought_

[caption #1942]
Listen, I have to tell you_ <D>
Naaah_never mind.

[caption #1943]
My house burned down!

[caption #1944]
Get outta the way!

[caption #1945]
I've never seen you before.

[caption #1946]
__ <D>Right!

[caption #1947]
And who might YOU be?

[caption #1948]
1 GP per night.
Why not relax for a spell?
<C> Yes
<C> No

[caption #1949]
Whatcha want with me?

[caption #1950]
An elderly gentleman, pure of heart, and learned in the ways of monsters_

[caption #1951]
FIRE!!

[caption #1952]
Uh?! What was that?

[caption #1953]
N'ga! Oh no!

[caption #1954]
Mama_it hurts_

[caption #1955]
Oh all right. Cure_

[caption #1956]
_medicine_where is my cure medicine?!

[caption #1957]
Mama!
Please use cure on me!

[caption #1958]
<A7>: Espers?
Espers_Hmm_
Not really familiar with that word.<EOP>
<A1>: But you've heard it before?

[caption #1959]
<A7>: Nope, uhn uhn_
Can't say I have.
<D>Honestly <D>can't say <D>I have! <D>

[caption #1960]
Grandpa!

[caption #1961]
<A7>: Hey_HEY!

[caption #1962]
<A7>: What in blazes_
What're you doing?

[caption #1963]
In her pictures she captures everything:
forests, water, light_
the very essence of life_

[caption #1964]
That's odd_

[caption #1965]
<A8>: Grandpa.
Who are these people? Friends? Can they use magic, too?
<A7>: Yaa! Hush!

[caption #1966]
<A8>: What a cute doggy!
<A3>: Get away.
He bites.

[caption #1967]
<A7>: Go to your room!
<A8>: I will not!
What a fussy old man!

[caption #1968]
<A7>: Please_leave us!
<A8>: Well_all right_

[caption #1969]
<A8>: What a sweet puppy!

[caption #1970]
<A7>: Hoo boy_
Seems to like your dog_

[caption #1971]
<A7>: This is terrible_

[caption #1972]
<A7>: Sorry.
<A3>: No problem.
The dog usually doesn't like people, though_

[caption #1973]
<A7>: Please excuse her.
She's just young.
<A1>: Hmmm_<EOP>
<A7>: This is just a back-water village. We can tell you nothing about your Espers_

[caption #1974]
<A1>: I see_
<D>There's something wrong here_
<A0>: Let's have a look around.

[caption #1975]
<A1>: Thanks for your time!
<A7>: Sorry I couldn't have been more helpful!

[caption #1976]
<A3>: Interceptor!
Come!

[caption #1977]
<A8>: Oh, all right_

[caption #1978]
<A7>: What a beautiful day.

[caption #1979]
<A8>: Interceptor, please come back again and play!

[caption #1980]
<A7>: This is awful!
<A8>_she's_

[caption #1981]
<A0>: <A8>'s in danger?
<A7>: Yes!<EOP>
She was at a neighbor's house when a fire broke out. I won't be able to stand it if something happens to her!

[caption #1982]
<A7>: Please!
Won't you help?!

[caption #1983]
<A1>: <A3>!

[caption #1984]
<A3>: Interceptor_
<D>Where are you?!

[caption #1985]
Waaah_my beautiful house_!

[caption #1986]
<A7>: <A8>'s inside that house!

[caption #1987]
FIRE!!

[caption #1988]
<A7>: <A8>!!!!!

[caption #1989]
<A1>: What're you doing?

[caption #1990]
Flames be GONE!!! <E$02><OP$12>

[caption #1991]
Mayor: Magic is forbidden!
<A0>: Magic_?!

[caption #1992]
<A7>: I don't care!
<D><A8>'s inside!!!

[caption #1993]
Mayor!!

[caption #1994]
Mayor: All right.
<D>We really have no choice.

[caption #1995]
Mayor: Stand back.

[caption #1996]
<A7>: It's no use.
The fire's too strong!<EOP>
Mayor: I think that's because they keep so many Fire Rods in here_

[caption #1997]
<A7>: I'm going in!

[caption #1998]
<A0>: Wait_I'm going too.
<A1>: Count me in. You'd better stay out here, gramps.<EOP>
<A7>: Fool!
I may be old, but I'm not powerless!

[caption #1999]
Quickly!

[caption #2000]
Is this the source of our blaze_?

[caption #2001]
<A1>: Try to avoid the flames.
<A0>: Easier said than done.<EOP>
<A7>: Hurry!
We have to find <A8>!

[caption #2002]
Uwaaa!!
Too late! <E$05><OP$12>

[caption #2003]
Huh!? <E$02><OP$12>

[caption #2004]
<A7>: <A8>!!!
Where are you?!

[caption #2005]
<A3>: Let's get outta here! <D>I'll use a Smoke Bomb!!

[caption #2006]
<A7>: Are you okay?
<A8>: Yes. Thanks, Grandpa!

[caption #2007]
<A7>: Save your thanks for these people.
<A8>: Thank you_

[caption #2008]
<A7>: I guess our town's little secret is out now_

[caption #2009]
<A1>: Can everyone here use magic? What's going on here?

[caption #2010]
<A7>: This is_
<D>_the village of the Mage Warriors_

[caption #2011]
<A7>: Long ago humans used Magicite to gain magical powers. They came to be known as Mage Warriors.

[caption #2012]
<A1>: But I thought they perished centuries ago_

[caption #2013]
<A7>: After the War of the Magi, the Espers fled to their new world behind the sealed gate.<EOP>
They wished to live peacefully, without fear of being used by humans. They left us here to fend for ourselves_<EOP>
But we were despised by normal people. Everyone felt we had begun that war_

[caption #2014]
<A7>: They sent people to hunt us down like animals.
There weren't even any trials_<EOP>
<A0>: Even though the only difference was that you could use magic_?

[caption #2015]
<A7>: A few Mage Warriors escaped and found their way here. They were our ancestors.<EOP>
Our powers have weakened over time, but some of it remains.

[caption #2016]
<A0>: Look, if you're up to it, we could use your help. <D><EOP>
<A7>: So, you're after the Espers, eh_?

[caption #2017]
<A7>: Well, I owe you for saving <A8>. <D>I'll help you find your Espers.

[caption #2018]
<A8>: Me too! <D>
<A7>: I don't think so.

[caption #2019]
<A8>: What a fuddy duddy_

[caption #2020]
<A1>: But_where do we start looking?<EOP>
<A7>: Hmm_
<D>If they're here, they must be  hiding in the mountains to the west.

[caption #2021]
<A1>: Why there?
<A7>: Those mountains have powerful magical properties.<EOP>
They say the Espers were created there_

[caption #2022]
<A0>: Maybe they're drawn to that place?

[caption #2023]
<A1>: I think it's worth a look.

[caption #2024]
<A3>: Don't misunderstand me. I just wanted my dog back.

[caption #2025]
<A1>: Going somewhere?
<A3>: I'll search for the Espers in my own way.

[caption #2026]
Ultros: G'heh, heh_these shiny statues are all mine!
These'll get Ziegfried's attention!

[caption #2027]
Ultros: Oh!
They're glowing!!
They're_beautiful!

[caption #2028]
<A1>: Hey, squidball!
Don't you ever learn?<EOP>
Ultros: Uh, well they always said I was a slow learner_
but I eat FAST!!

[caption #2029]
<A8>: Hey! Did you see me? I was awesome!
Wouldn't I be more helpful than Gramps?<EOP>
<A7>: G_GRAMPS!!?

[caption #2030]
<A0>: I suppose it wouldn't hurt to have you along_

[caption #2031]
<A7>: I can't believe it_
<D>The Statues_!
<A0>: [The] Statues?!

[caption #2032]
The birth of magic_<EOP>
3 goddesses were banished here. In time they began quarreling, which led to all-out war.<EOP>
Those unlucky humans who got in the way were transformed into Espers, and used as living war machines_

[caption #2033]
<A1>: Some faint letters are carved on the back of the stone figures_

[caption #2034]
<A1>: Say, old man, what else can you tell us about these goddesses?

[caption #2035]
<A7>: They quite literally created magic, as we know it.<EOP>
<A1>: So, they're the goddesses of magic, then?
<A7>: You could say that.

[caption #2036]
<A0>: I can feel their power_
<A7>: The Statues are the source of all magic.<EOP>
It's said the Espers made these images, and put them in a very special place.<EOP>
These represent power beyond all comprehension_

[caption #2037]
<A0>: Our Espers no doubt came to this island to bask in all this magical power!

[caption #2038]
The goddesses finally realized that they were being laughed at by those who had banished them here.<EOP>
In a rare moment of mutual clarity, they agreed to seal themselves away from the world.<EOP>
With their last ounce of energy they gave the Espers back their own free will, and then transformed themselves_<EOP>
_into stone.
Their only request was that the Espers keep them sealed away for all eternity.

[caption #2039]
The Espers created these statues as a symbol of their vow to let the goddesses sleep in peace.<EOP>
The Espers have sworn to keep the goddesses' power from being abused.

[caption #2040]
<A1>: Phew_what a story.<EOP>
<A0>: If the Espers were attracted here by these statues, they must be around here somewhere!

[caption #2041]
<A1>: Say, old timer,
what happened to the stone goddesses?<EOP>
<A7>: Legend has it that they're hidden somewhere beyond the reach of humans.<EOP>
I'd say they're beyond the sealed gate_

[caption #2042]
<A0>: I wonder if the barrier that protects that place is generated by those stone goddesses?

[caption #2043]
<A8>: Are these_Espers?!

[caption #2044]
<A0>: I didn't think they'd look so_ <D><EOP>
<A1>: Gramps, take <A8> and clear outta here!

[caption #2045]
<A7>: What about you?

[caption #2046]
Yura: Halt!

[caption #2047]
<A8>: What is it?
<A7>: I sense some immense magical power in <A0>_ <D>It_frightens me_

[caption #2048]
<A1>: I wonder if she's gonna go ballistic again?!

[caption #2049]
Yura: You're somehow different_
<D>I sense a familiar power radiating from you_<EOP>
<A0>: Yes.

[caption #2050]
<A7>: You're the Espers that fled through the sealed gate?<EOP>
Yura: As a rule, we are not allowed to visit to your world.<EOP>
We few had gathered near the gate, and were wondering how we could save the Espers that had been kidnapped.<EOP>
It was just a coincidence that <A0> appeared when she did_

[caption #2051]
<A0>: I felt_
your presence_
through the gate.<EOP>
Yura: We bolted the moment <A0> opened the gate.
But once in your world, we lost control of our powers.

[caption #2052]
Yura: We completely leveled a city_and took some innocent lives_

[caption #2053]
<A0>: That's what happened to me! I lost all control of my power_

[caption #2054]
<A7>: There must be something in your world that allows you to focus your power differently.<EOP>
You must use caution while in our world_

[caption #2055]
Yura: We are deeply sorry to have caused you humans such suffering and pain.

[caption #2056]
<A1>: The past is history. The Empire seems to want to talk peace with you. Why not come with us?<EOP>
Yura: They would forgive us so easily?

[caption #2057]
<A1>: Let's go to Thamasa and talk with General <A10>.
<A0>: Right!

[caption #2058]
<A1>: General <A10>.<EOP>
<A10>: <A1>_you're back! And you've made the Espers understand our desire for peace!

[caption #2059]
<A10>: I am General <A10>.
May I have your name, please?
Yura: I am called Yura.

[caption #2060]
Yura: We have done something inexcusable to your people.<EOP>
Yura: This probably isn't the time or place to ask for your forgiveness, but_

[caption #2061]
<A10>: Speak no further.
It is we who owe you an apology. We hungered for your power_<EOP>
How close we came to reenacting the War of the Magi!!!<EOP>
Yura: We must put this all behind us.

[caption #2062]
Kefka: I don't care for the appearance of this pitiful little hamlet_
So burn it!!

[caption #2063]
<A1>: I believe our job is finally over! I, for one, could use some peace and quiet_<EOP>
<A6>: Let's return to Vector.

[caption #2064]
<A6>: Please, not another word.

[caption #2065]
<A8>: I'm too hot, Grandpa.
<A7>: Kids!!

[caption #2066]
<A10>: Kefka! What ARE you doing?!
Kefka: G'ha, ha, ha! Emperor's orders!<EOP>
I'm to bring the Magicite remains of these Espers to his excellency! Behold! A Magicite mother lode!!

[caption #2067]
<A10>: Kefka! No!

[caption #2068]
Kefka: Shut up!

[caption #2069]
M.Tek Trooper: General <A10>, prepare yourself!

[caption #2070]
<A10>: No.
I won't let this happen!

[caption #2071]
<A10>: Kefka!
<D>Your behavior is dishonorable!
I can't allow this!

[caption #2072]
Kefka: Hee, hee_!
How 'bout a little Magitek mayhem!

[caption #2073]
Kefka: Now for a little Magicite hocus-pocus_!

[caption #2074]
Kefka: Whoa! Yes, I feel some incredible magic power here, today! Wave after wave of pure, magical energy_

[caption #2075]
Kefka: I'd say you're all charged up, boys and girls_or whatever_<EOP>
Say, remind me to show you my Magicite collection someday! You might see a few familiar faces!!!

[caption #2076]
Kefka: First, let's neutralize your abilities.

[caption #2077]
Kefka: Now, little Espers_
Let's see whatcha got!

[caption #2078]
Kefka: This is ridiculous!
I had no idea you were such wimps! <D>Time to put a stop to all of this.

[caption #2079]
Kefka: Eh?!
You wanna take me on?
Fine. Here I am_

[caption #2080]
Kefka: Phew_
I think I have plenty of Magicite for the time being_<EOP>
that is, until I make my way through your precious sealed gate!!

[caption #2081]
It hurts_

[caption #2082]
Curse the Empire_Curse Kefka!

[caption #2083]
The Espers_are they all_?

[caption #2084]
Mayor: I can only take some comfort in the fact that there were so few casualties.

[caption #2085]
<A0>: General Leo_

[caption #2086]
<A0>: People only seem to want power. Do they really want to be like me?

[caption #2087]
<A0>: I_I wanted to learn so much more from you_

[caption #2088]
Interceptor!?
That's a nasty wound!

[caption #2089]
<A1>: We not only lost <A10>, but <A3>, too_
<D>Curse the Empire!

[caption #2090]
<A1>: This'll have to do_

[caption #2091]
<A6>: He was so gentle_

[caption #2092]
<A8>: I'll go with you.

[caption #2093]
<A1>: Now I'm worried about <A4> and the others_<EOP>
<A0>: I wish I could say they were safe_

[caption #2094]
<A9>: We've been had!!
The Emperor is a liar!

[caption #2095]
<A2>: Thanks to <A4>, we escaped before anything bad happened_

[caption #2096]
<A1>: Way to go, <A4>!

[caption #2097]
<A4>: I got to know the gal who brought us tea.
After a while, she just blurted out the whole crooked plan.

[caption #2098]
<A5>: So_you finally hit pay dirt, eh?

[caption #2099]
<A4>: Watch your mouth!
There're ladies present!
I was a perfect gentleman.

[caption #2100]
<A1>: General <A10>'s gone_
<D>Kefka did him in_ <D>

[caption #2101]
<A2>: Sir <A10>?! Gone?!
<D>What a waste_
He was their finest soldier_

[caption #2102]
<A4>: We need to rethink our plans. Let's return to the airship.

[caption #2103]
<A7>: May I accompany you?

[caption #2104]
<A4>: Who're you?

[caption #2105]
<A1>: He's one of this town's citizens.

[caption #2106]
<A0>: He's descended from the Mage Warriors of yore_
I think he can be a big help.

[caption #2107]
<A7>: We must expect the Empire to flex its new-found muscle soon.

[caption #2108]
<A8>: I'm coming along, too.

[caption #2109]
<A5>: Yeah, right kid!

[caption #2110]
<A8>: What?
Who is this puffed up aerobics instructor, anyway?<EOP>
<A5>: Kid's got quite a lip!

[caption #2111]
<A8>: Aaack!
I'm gonna paint your portrait!

[caption #2112]
Uwaaa! S_stop!

[caption #2113]
<A7>: All right all ready!
If you insist_
<A8>: That's better!

[caption #2114]
<A8>: What's wrong, lover boy?
<A4>: How old are you?
<A8>: 10_why?

[caption #2115]
<A4>: You've grown up entirely too fast!
<D>Lighten up, okay?!

[caption #2116]
General Leo_

[caption #2117]
Gestahl: Fuwa, ha, ha!
Now THIS is power!
This, and my Magicite_
now nothing can stop me!

[caption #2118]
<A7>: The beginning of all magic_
<A0>: Those?<EOP>
<A7>: It is said that they somehow neutralized each other's power, then sealed themselves away_<EOP>
<A7>: If the 3 statues should ever be moved out of alignment, the resulting inbalance of power would_<EOP>
_rearrange the face of our planet_
<A0>: What?!

[caption #2119]
Quick! Back to the airship!!

[caption #2120]
<A9>: The Empire's after the sealed gate! They're looking for some statues or something.<EOP>
<A7>: No!!!

[caption #2121]
<A6>: What's wrong, <A0>?<EOP>
<A0>: The island_
The world is groaning in pain_

[caption #2122]
Gestahl: Oh, those silly Espers! To think they opened the gate themselves! The Statues should be just ahead.<EOP>
If we can just get our hands on them, we'll have everything we ever dreamed of!

[caption #2123]
Gestahl: Come quickly!

[caption #2124]
<A9>: Quick!
Let's jump onto that thing!<EOP>
Only 3 allowed in your party.
The others must stay on board.

[caption #2125]
Only 3 allowed in your party.
The others must stay on board.

We're surrounded!
Let's give 'em a bloody lip!

Something_
curious_approaches!!

[caption #2128]
Kefka, Gestahl_and the Statues are just ahead.

[caption #2129]
<A3>: Down with the Empire! Once I outlived my usefulness, they tried to off me!<EOP>
[We thought you were a goner!]

[caption #2130]
<A3>: Is Interceptor all right?<EOP>
[He's fine.
Come on, let's go!]

[caption #2131]
<A3>: Forget about me.<EOP>
[We can't just leave you!]

[caption #2132]
<A3>: I sold my skills to the Empire_
I have no right to fight together with you.

[caption #2133]
<A3>: We meet again.

[caption #2134]
The airship's below!<EOP>
Do you wish to return?

<A6>: Emperor Gestahl!
Please, stop this madness!

Come to me, my pretty!<EOP>
You and Kefka were given life to serve me!!
It is your birthright to rule the world with me!!

Kefka: Take this sword!
Take care of them. Immediately!!

<D>You've watched over me the whole time?

Cid: Yes, and I'm about out of energy.

[caption #2170]
Cid: We're on a tiny, deserted island. After the world crumbled, I awoke to find us here together with_<EOP>
_a few strangers.
<A6>: The world_!
So, it wasn't just a dream.

[caption #2171]
<A6>: Where are my friends? Where's <A1>_?<EOP>
Cid: I don't know.
I only know we're here_
Maybe we're the only people left alive_<EOP>
Cid: Since that day, the world's continued its slide into ruin. Animals and plants are dying_<EOP>
The few others who washed up here with us passed away of boredom and despair.

they're probably all gone_

[caption #2200]
Thanks for saving the child!

[caption #2201]
I was on lookout duty for Kefka_
But I lost my nerve_

[caption #2202]
Anyone who opposes Kefka is doomed. He uses his [Light of Judgment] from high atop his tower to burn whole towns.

[caption #2203]
I saw it! Kefka used a light beam to burn the village of Mobliz, to the east.<EOP>
Most of the adults there perished trying to save their children_

[caption #2204]
The [Serpent Trench] used to be deep under water.
Now it's above sea level.<EOP>
Some [Cult of Kefka] members have built a tower there_

[caption #2205]
Many monsters nowadays attack with [Zombie], [Petrify] and the like. Have you equipped suitable Relics?

[caption #2206]
To the east you'll find the [Serpent Trench.] Further east you'll find the village of Mobliz.<EOP>
Boy, the Light of Judgment really fried that town_

[caption #2207]
Head north on the Serpent Trench and you'll reach Nikeah. Ships still sail from there.

[caption #2208]
Heeeeee_
I've never been more frightened!

[caption #2209]
My child's inside!
Do something!

[caption #2210]
Must have irritated Kefka_

[caption #2211]
There are monsters inside! They keep petrifying everyone who goes in to help. You using suitable Relics?

[caption #2212]
We resisted Kefka, so he unleashed his Light of Judgment on us!

[caption #2213]
Hurry, or the house'll collapse!

[caption #2214]
<A6>: <A5>!<EOP>
<A5>: Hey! <A6>!

<A5>: But of course!
You think a minor thing like the end of the world was gonna do me in?

[caption #2222]
<A6>: I thought everyone was gone_
I had given up all hope_<EOP>
But_ <D>fortunately, I was wrong! Now I know they're all alive! We need to find everyone! Then_

We smash Kefka, and deliver peace unto the world_

[caption #2225]
Come on!!
Please help!

[caption #2226]
All I can do now is restore your health.
Please_go back inside and save that child!!

[caption #2227]
[I'm scared_!]
[Don't worry, you're safe now.]

[caption #2228]
Did you see that tower_?

[caption #2229]
Kefka's up there, 'n he's using the power of the Statues_
He's like a god_

[caption #2230]
Everything changed on that day_

[caption #2231]
Anyone who opposes Kefka gets his or her town fried by the [Light of Judgment.]

[caption #2232]
On THAT day, debris from all over the world floated eerily to the center of this land mass, and formed that tower_

[caption #2233]
How can ya make a GP in a world like this?

[caption #2234]
When the world was ripped apart, many long-sealed monsters were released_<EOP>
Phunbaba_Doom Gaze_
And the 8 Dragons_

[caption #2235]
I saw Doom Gaze soaring through the sky!
I'd rather take an acid bath than fight that thing!

[caption #2236]
Uh? You again_?
<D>Oh, sorry. You look just like a man who was here searching for his friends_<EOP>
He said he was going north, to Tzen.

[caption #2237]

You're the spittin' image of a man who came through here recently.

<A8>: Come along now_
We're all glad to see you!

[caption #2244]
<A7>: Whoa!
Well I'll be_
All right, make room for me!

[caption #2245]
The members of the [Cult of Kefka] live in this tower.
There's something wondrous atop it!<EOP>
You can only use magic attacks inside, so unless your magic's strong, you'll never make it to the top!

Hooey!!!! <D>
Right, here's the scoop:
Beneath the Desert of Figaro lies an ancient castle_<EOP>
_loaded with treasure.
By the way, an old man who lives in the Weapon Shop in Narshe is looking for you_

[caption #2249]
No use talking to them. They've sold their hearts to Kefka.
All they do is mope around, thinking of him_

[caption #2250]

<A0>: That is <D>I_ <D>um_
I can't fight any longer_

[caption #2259]
<A0>: The very day the world fell, Kefka turned some kind of beam on this town.<EOP>
Almost all of the adults perished trying to save their children_

[caption #2260]
<A0>: There were only children here_ <D>
The moment I arrived, I felt needed_

[caption #2261]
Duane: You can't take <A0> away!

[caption #2262]
Katarin: Duane_ <D><EOP>
Please excuse him. It's just that if <A0> goes, she takes with her the very spirit of our survival_

[caption #2263]
<A0>: I don't know why these kids need me_<EOP>
But they've made me feel things I've never felt before.<EOP>
The moment I sensed this, I lost my will to fight.

[caption #2264]
<A0>: I can honestly say I don't know what's going on inside of me_<EOP>
And the more I try to understand it, the less inclined I am to fight.

[caption #2265]
Help!!! Run!!!
Phunbaba's coming!!

[caption #2266]
<A0>: Phunbaba's an ancient demon who was released when the world was undone.

[caption #2267]
<A0>!!
Wake up!
Uh, oh_here it comes!!

[caption #2268]
<A0>: I've really lost it_
My fighting edge_

[caption #2269]
Mama!
Are you okay?!

[caption #2270]
<A0>: I'm staying here.
As you can see, I can't be of any help to you.<EOP>
And besides, the children really need me.
[But <A0>_!]

[caption #2271]
<A0>: Maybe after a little more time passes_
I need to understand what's happening to me_

But Duane seems miserable_

The thieves are hanging out at the coffee shop. They all escaped from Figaro Castle.

[caption #2326]
The road you followed here used to be under water.

[caption #2327]
After the end of the world,
I awoke all alone in Doma Castle.<EOP>
When I would try to sleep there, demons would come for me_ Oh! I don't want to remember that!

Henchman: G'ho ho, do we ever!

Gerad: Yeah, You lead the way since it's buried.

[caption #2334]
I understand they escaped from Figaro Castle's prison.

[caption #2335]
From out of nowhere a bunch of huge sandworms burrowed into the prison!<EOP>
We followed their tunnels back to the surface and escaped.

[caption #2336]
Our last boss perished that day. We met up with Gerad in this town.

[caption #2337]
The boss wants to sneak into Figaro Castle. He wants to get our booty back from the storage room there.

[caption #2338]
We'll enter da castle through a secret cave dat only we knows about!

[caption #2339]
I've been chatting with the boss of this gang, Gerad.
He's kinda handsome!

<A6>: Don't play possum with me! <A4>?
Or have you somehow lost your memory?

Gerad: Listen, my lady,

Figaro Castle had an accident under the desert.
Don't know what happened to its people_

[caption #2350]
That sweet little girl stopped coming around right after the world ended_

[caption #2351]
I'm so relieved the Empire's finally outta here!

[caption #2352]
Now all these thieves are demanding all our time.
Phew_I'm exhausted.

[caption #2353]
There's nothing left of my home town.

We're storming Figaro Castle! That treasure's rightfully ours!

We have to start rebuilding!

Okay!
Nothing's gonna stop us!

[Now_what was a monster doing in that picture?!]<EOP>
Owzer: It all started when I bought a stone at the Auction House.<EOP>
I took one look at it and suddenly felt I needed a portrait of Starlet.<EOP>
I asked several artists, but none could muster enough skill.<EOP>
It was then that I heard about <A8>'s amazing ability.
I brought her here, and put her to work.<EOP>
But while she was painting, that thing came along_ <D>
It must have been enticed here by that stone.

[caption #2720]
Where is the stone_?<EOP>
Owzer: The stone? <D>
Over on that bookshelf.

Aged Man: What is this?!
What's with this [son] business? I never had a son!

[caption #2828]
Aged Man: But now that you mention it, I once had a terrible dream. <D> In it, a demon-child was born!<EOP>
I grabbed the creature, and rushed off to the Veldt with it_
<D>It was crying like crazy when I arrived on the Veldt.<EOP>
<A5>: But, Sir_!

[caption #2829]
Aged Man: I left the child there_ <D>
And without looking back,
I turned and started to run.<EOP>
<A5>: I'm trying to tell you_

[caption #2830]
Aged Man: Suddenly the crying stopped. I turned around and saw a frightful monster_<EOP>
Hideous! Still gives me the shakes.
<A5>: I give up_

[caption #2831]
Aged Man: But you, young man, your parents must be proud of you! I still have dreams of that demon child_<EOP>
Frightening_

I was wondering if you knew anything about Emperor Gestahl's map_]<EOP>
Aged Man: Map_?! <D>
Everyone's askin' 'bout that map!<EOP>
Pardon?!<EOP>
Aged Man: Little while ago, some guy wearin' a bandana asked for the map.
So I told him!<EOP>
W_where is it?

First time I've been back in a while, and the village looks trashed.
What on earth happened?

I am Gungho.
Warrior extraordinaire from the town of Thamasa.

<A7>: G_Gungho?!

If you're looking for the man dressed all in black, he left for the colosseum.

[caption #2846]
One day, a man working for an aristocrat in Jidoor came and took that young woman back with him!

[caption #2847]
I saw a monster floating in the sky! It looked just like a fish.

[caption #2848]
All the fun places are gone now.

[caption #2849]
For the first time in 50 years, Ebot's Rock is above water!
Head north of town if you want to see it.

[caption #2850]
Gungho: Is that you,
<A7>?
Have you come back to hunt Hidon?

[caption #2851]
I've got <A7> on my side now, but what a monumental bag of hot air!

[caption #2852]
Gungho: He'll never change.
That's who he is!

[caption #2853]
When you were younger you hunted Hidon, the legendary monster. But you quit before you found it_

[caption #2854]
<A7>: I didn't really quit!<EOP>
It's just that, well, the monster lives only on Ebot's Rock, which has been submerged for some time.<EOP>
Gungho: You never could give me an honest answer.

[caption #2855]
Gungho: What a buffoon!!

[caption #2856]
Mayor: It's only been a year

But it feels like forever.

<A7>: Who did this to you?<EOP>
Gungho: It was_Hidon, the beast you and I used to hunt.
I almost had it_

[caption #2862]
Gungho: Oooh_cough, cough_

[caption #2863]
Gungho: <A7>_
Please_you must avenge me_

[caption #2864]
<A7>: You took on Hidon_?

[caption #2865]
<A8>: Gramps!
Why are you hesitating!

[caption #2866]
<A7>: Well_ <D>I spent my
youth chasing that creature.
To do it again at this age is more than I bargained for.

[caption #2867]
<A7>: Gungho_
rest easy, I'll do it for you!

[caption #2868]
<A8>: Just a minute!
You don't think you're going alone, do you?

[caption #2869]
<A7>: I spent too many years of my life hunting that thing. It is my obsession, not yours.

[caption #2870]
<A8>: But Grandpa!
This [obsession] of yours could easily slay you!<EOP>
You're my Grandfather.
I can't just sit idly by and watch you go.

[caption #2871]
<A7>: Sorry, <A8>.
I'm so grateful that you care!<EOP>
But as its name implies, the Hidon is extremely difficult to find.<EOP>
Unless I go alone, it will not show itself.

Why do people cling to life when they know they can't live forever?<EOP>
Think how meaningless each of your lives is!

Worry about the Esper later.

Kefka: Oh, General Goody Two-Shoes has something to say.  How quaint.

[caption #3085]
Kefka: Those soldiers were just disposable pawns.<D>
The only one of any value is the girl.<EOP>
<A10>: She's a human being, Kefka.

[caption #3086]
Kefka: If you say so.<EOP>
Either way, a weapon like her shouldn't be allowed to fall into enemy hands.

[caption #3087]
<A10>: [Weapon]_

[caption #3088]
<A10>: Kefka, what's the meaning of this?! Those were our own men!

[caption #3089]
Gestahl: Fwa ha ha, what a magnificent demonstration. You have trained the girl up well, Kefka.

[caption #3090]
<A10>: But, sire, was this truly necessary?<EOP>
Those men had bravely served our country, and <A0>_

[caption #3091]
Gestahl: Worry not, <A10>, this is but a small price to pay for the power that will elevate our nation to greatness.<EOP>
Magic is a force beyond your comprehension.<D>
If you had accepted a Magitek infusion, you would understand.

[caption #3092]
<A10>: _Understood, my liege.

In any case, I won't let anyone hurt you. I promise.

<A3>: I've got a job to complete. Come, Interceptor.

[caption #3097]
Someone's put a bounty on my head and they've got a nasty assassin after me.<EOP>
I hear there's a martial arts master somewhere on this mountain but_I'm afraid to go in!

[caption #3098]
No visible wounds_It's like he simply dropped dead!

[caption #3099]
GAH!<EOP>
Don't sneak up on people like that!
Gonna give a guy a heart attack!

<A10>: Thanks to your cooperation, we were able to occupy this town with minimal casualties.<EOP>
Rich Man: I just feel like I betrayed everyone, though_

[caption #3101]
<A10>: Sometimes suffering is unavoidable_
Often all we can do is manage its extent.

[caption #3102]
<A10>: If the Empire had proceeded with its originally-planned armed invasion,<EOP>
countless more would have died on both sides.<EOP>
Thus, this is the optimal outcome.

[caption #3103]
Rich Man: At least the king was able to make it out before all this went down.

[caption #3104]
<A10>: The king?
King <A4> was here?

[caption #3105]
<A10>: Tell me, was he accompanied by a young woman?<EOP>
Rich Man: When is he not?<EOP>
<A10>: _

[caption #3106]
<A10>: Perhaps it would be best if I question the townspeople.<EOP>
Thank you again.

[caption #3107]
<A3>: I hear you paid off the aristocrat to take this town without a fight.<EOP>
If you're still feeling generous, I might have information on that girl you're after.

[caption #3108]
<A10>: I am not [after] her, I am merely concerned for her well-being.

[caption #3109]
<A10>: Was she here? Was she in good health?

[caption #3110]
<A10>: _Very well, take this.<EOP>
There can be more depending on the value of the information you provide.

[caption #3111]
<A3>: A girl passed through here not long ago.<EOP>
She was accompanied by the King of Figaro and a man who looked like a petty thief.<EOP>
She seemed timid and confused, however appeared to be with her companions willingly.

[caption #3112]
They left for Mount Kolts.  There may be a hidden stronghold in the mountains beyond.<EOP>
For an additional fee, I can return her to you.<EOP>
<A10>: _

[caption #3113]
<A10>: No, that won't be necessary.<EOP>
If she is truly acting of her own free will, I have no desire to have her robbed of it again.

[caption #3114]
Instead, I have a different request:<EOP>
Follow them,<D> watch after them,<D> see that she is safe,<EOP>
and make periodic reports back to me.

[caption #3115]
I take it this amount is sufficient for such a job?

[caption #3116]
<A3>: Come, Interceptor.

[caption #3117]
<A10>: I have new intel that there may be a Returner base in the Sabre Mountains.<EOP>
Gather soldiers and set up a blockade.

[caption #3118]
I must return to the front at Doma. The conflict there is escalating and I cannot be away for long.<EOP>
I trust you to manage things here in my absence.

[caption #3119]
<A10>: War does not suit you, <A0>.<EOP>
I hope you are able to escape from this, too.

[caption #3120]
<A10>: What about generals?

[caption #3121]
No? You sure?

[caption #3122]
Okay_

[caption #3123]
Keep up the good work young man. I'm sure your grandfather appreciates it.

[caption #3124]
<A10>: Take a break, soldier. You've earned it.<EOP>
Soldier: Of course! Thank you, sir!

[caption #3125]
General! Let me test my strength against you!

[caption #3126]
Ha ha, should've known I'd stand no chance against you!
Gonna have to take a breather_

[caption #3127]
The town's secure, General.

[caption #3128]
Glad I didn't have to use this on civilians_

[caption #3129]
A toast to our victory, General!

[caption #3130]
General, you're a music buff, right?<EOP>
Why don't you play us a celebratory song on the record player there?

[caption #3131]
Much better!

[caption #3132]
You're looking for a girl? You Imperials took everything from us, now you're after our women?!

[caption #3133]
Uh oh, is someone in trouble? It wasn't me!

[caption #3134]
A girl? Sorry, you're not my type.

[caption #3135]
I have nothing to sell to the likes of you!

[caption #3136]
No cheating!

[caption #3137]
Duncan's Wife: I'm sorry, I can't help you.
You see, my husband recently passed away_

[caption #3138]
<A10>: My condolences, ma'am.

[caption #3139]
Did we_?

[caption #3140]
Duncan's Wife: No_ <D>Though perhaps I would have preferred if he'd died fighting you.

[caption #3141]
You're not much older than my husband's students.
Why is this the path you chose?

[caption #3142]
<A10>: Please understand that I mean neither you nor this town any ill will.

[caption #3143]
I chose this path simply because I feared the alternative would cause even more harm.<EOP>
I'm afraid that is the only excuse I have.

[caption #3144]
Come on, General, fight serious!
You let me win that one!

[caption #3145]
<A1>: Why were you locked up like that, anyway?

[caption #3146]
<A6>: My subordinates don't trust me. They see my powers as a threat. <EOP>
Other infusion recipients lost their minds and souls to the process, so I suppose their fear is warranted.

[caption #3147]
One of them is plotting something heinous. <EOP>
My speaking out against it was all the excuse they needed to brand me a traitor. <EOP>
<A1>: Well, I won't turn on you like that. I promise.

[caption #3148]
<A6>: ...Anyway, this way leads out.
We should get moving before they realize I'm gone.

[caption #3149]
<A0>: Moogles!

[caption #3150]
They're so cute and fluffy_
I want to pet them all!! <EOP>
Banon: Ho, ho, girls will like what they like.

[caption #3151]
<A4>: Really? <D>
Because I've never seen <A0> react so strongly to <D> well <D> anything_

[caption #3152]
<A0>: I'm sorry_
Is it strange?

[caption #3153]
<A4>: No, no. I'm the one who should be sorry.
I'm just glad to see you coming out of your shell.

[caption #3154]
<A0>: It's true that I still have no strong feelings about the war, the Empire, or the Returners_ <EOP>
I come with you because I don't know what else to do.

[caption #3155]
But I hope if I'm able to talk to that Esper, things will start making sense. <EOP>
Banon: Then let's stop dilly-dallying and get to that Esper!

[caption #3156]
For example, the acclaimed opera penned by-

[caption #3157]
Huh?
I swear I heard him whisper something_<EOP>
[Please stop him_]

[caption #3158]
Kefka: NO ONE CARES!<EOP>
If they offer aid to the Returners, may as well just get rid of 'em all.<EOP>
<A10>: They're human beings, Kefka, just like you and me.
Please remember that.

[caption #3159]
What the_?<EOP>
Why even bother?

[caption #3160]

             Found 1 GP!

[caption #3161]
<A10>: I came as quickly as I could, my liege, per your summons regarding General <A6>_

[caption #3162]
Gestahl: Ah, yes, that matter.
A shame, really.

[caption #3163]
<A10>: You mean she's already_?

[caption #3164]
Gestahl: No. <D>
I received word that she escaped and embedded herself within a Returner faction.<EOP>
Whether it is as a traitor or a double agent remains to be seen.

[caption #3165]
So she's safe_

[caption #3166]
<A10>: I see_
I cannot fathom a reason for her to turn on us so abruptly_<EOP>
But acting as a spy doesn't sit well with me, either_

[caption #3167]
Gestahl: When dealing with lawless rebels, sometimes underhanded tactics are necessary, <A10>.

[caption #3168]
<A10>: As you say, sire.<EOP>
However, I would like to continue to execute my duties without resorting to such measures.<EOP>
If the matter with General <A6> is settled for now, I shall return to Doma.

[caption #3169]
Gestahl: That won't be necessary.

[caption #3170]
<A10>: My liege?

[caption #3171]
Gestahl: Doma is now under our complete control.
It fell while you were away.

[caption #3172]
<A10>: But_ how?<EOP>
For three years we have been unable to penetrate their defenses, so for it to fall so quickly_

[caption #3173]
Your Majesty, I must know how this was accomplished!

[caption #3174]
Gestahl: __

[caption #3175]
I myself am not aware of the full details, and Kefka has already left for another mission.

[caption #3176]
However, I do know that he was able to accomplish in a day what you failed to do in three years.

[caption #3177]
I have already lost a Magitek Elite and now a general to the Returners.<EOP>
I need to know that I can still rely on you, <A10>.

[caption #3178]
<A10>: Of course, my liege!
My heart beats only for my country's sake!

[caption #3179]
Gestahl: Good, good.<EOP>
You have valuable qualities that Kefka lacks. <D>
I would hate to lose you, too.

[caption #3180]
<A10>: I am humbled by your praise, Your Majesty.<EOP>
I pledge that I shall continue to live by the example I wish to set for our people.

[caption #3181]
<A0>: Even after everything we've gone through together, I still can't say I feel anything [special] for anyone here_

[caption #3182]
You said yourself that your heart can't be moved.<EOP>
Does having magic_ <D>keep you from feeling?

[caption #3183]
<A6>: __ If it does, all the better for it, I'd say.

[caption #3184]
<A0>: __

[caption #3185]
Kefka: Oh my, an Esper, a runaway puppet, and a traitor general all in one place!
This must be my lucky day!

[caption #3186]
Since you left them unattended, I helped myself to some of your soldiers, General <A6>. <D>
Hope you don't mind!<EOP>
I'm sure a few of them have a bone to pick with you for so selfishly abandoning them.

[caption #3187]
Don't let me get in your way, fellas!
Have at them!

[caption #3188]
<A2>: Wh_ What dark sorcery is this?!

[caption #3189]
A castle is the firm bedrock of its nation! It cannot move!
Preposterous!

[caption #3190]
<A4>: It's called [technology], my friend.
Perhaps you should look into it!

[caption #3191]
<A5>: Gya ha ha!
Yeah, Figaro's technology is pretty incredible!

[caption #3192]
<A10>: It is an impressive technological feat!
Surely it can be used to improve quality of life!

[caption #3193]
<A6>: Hmph_ The Empire stereotypes the Domans as luddites.<EOP>
I thought it was an exaggeration, but_

[caption #3194]
<A9>: Ha ha, I prefer to travel far above ground, thank you very much!

[caption #3195]
<A0>: Dark sorcery?
No_ I don't think this is magic_

[caption #3196]
<A1>: Yeah, who would've thought a castle could go where even a chocobo can't?!

[caption #3212]
<A10>: Welcome back, General <A6>.<EOP>
I am glad to see you are unharmed, though I wish our reunion was under better circumstances.

[caption #3213]
Why did you abandon your post?<EOP>
I have heard so many rumors, but I wanted to hear an answer straight from you.

[caption #3214]
<A6>: __ Because what the Empire is doing is wrong.<EOP>
Crushing towns_ <D>
forcing their people to join our ranks_<EOP>
Poisoning kingdoms_

[caption #3215]
<A10>: I can genuinely sympathize with how you feel_

[caption #3216]
But it was precisely because I was NOT there that such atrocities were able to happen.<EOP>
I agree that Kefka has become even more brazen,<EOP>
which is why it is even more imperative that I remain here and hold a firm line.<EOP>
I must maintain the Emperor's favor<EOP>
if I am to remain in a position where I can most effectively protect our people from Kefka's influence.

[caption #3217]
Even if maintaining that favor means_ <D>overlooking certain things_

[caption #3218]
_ Did you see <A0>?
Is she all right?<EOP>
<A6>: She's_

[caption #3219]
She transformed into_ something_ that looked like an Esper.<EOP>
She's been in a catatonic state in Zozo ever since_<EOP>
An Esper there told us that one of the Espers in the Facility might be able to help her, which is why we came.

[caption #3220]
<A10>: __ I see_<EOP>
<A6>: You don't sound surprised.

[caption #3221]
<A10>: _ I was 12 years old, still in the Academy, when the Espers were first brought to Vector.

[caption #3222]
Gestahl: Behold, cadets, these creatures represent the future of our glorious Empire!

[caption #3223]
Kefka: I thought this was supposed to be a demonstration for elite graduates.<EOP>
Why is there some kid here?

[caption #3224]
Commander: Yes, sir, this is Cadet <A10>, sir.<EOP>
He may be young, but he is a prodigy in both combat and leadership. I'm sure he will serve the Empire well.

[caption #3225]
<A10>: My liege, it is an honor to be here in your presence.

[caption #3226]
Gestahl: Oh, very obedient, too.
I'm impressed.
You indeed have potential.

[caption #3227]
Kefka: Don't forget, Your Majesty, as soon as everything is ready, I'M going to be first!

[caption #3228]

                  Waah!

[caption #3229]
<A10>: Is that a baby?<EOP>
Gestahl: Indeed. She was recovered from those monsters.<EOP>
<A10>: What about her parents?

[caption #3230]
Kefka: Quiet, you!

[caption #3231]
Gestahl: _Her parents are no longer with us, I'm afraid. We are all she has.<EOP>
<A10>: I see_

[caption #3232]
<A10>: Don't worry, we won't let those monsters touch you ever again.

[caption #3233]
Kefka: Now, give her here.
She is_ quite precious.<EOP>
We'll be sure to take good care of her.

[caption #3234]
I didn't understand it at the time, but that [monster] in the capsule was likely_ <E$0C><OP$12>

[caption #3235]
<A10>: So you have heard the rumors as well_

[caption #3236]
<A6>: It's not just a rumor. Hearing Kefka's plan for Doma is what turned me against the Empire in the first place.<EOP>
I traveled with the last survivor of Doma.
He lost his entire family_

[caption #3237]
<A10>: __I still wish to wait for the formal investigation to complete.<EOP>
Just because I can imagine Kefka doing something so heinous does not give me the right to rush to judgment.<EOP>
<A6>: And if the investigation finds it to be true?
Then what?

[caption #3238]
No... because if what you say is true_<EOP>
Then it is precisely BECAUSE I left my post that such atrocities were able to happen.<EOP>
Kefka has become even more brazen in the power vacuum you left behind, corrupting the national conscience.<EOP>
The more power he gains, the more others with dark impulses feel enabled to act upon them.

[caption #3239]
Which is why it is even more imperative that I remain here and hold a firm line.<EOP>
I must maintain the Emperor's favor_<EOP>
if I am to remain in a position where I can most effectively protect our people from Kefka's influence.

[caption #3240]
<A10>: _Then I will trust our justice system to deal with Kefka appropriately.<EOP>
<A6>: The same justice system that was going to have me executed without a trial for whistleblowing about this?<EOP>
<A10>: __!

[caption #3241]
<A6>: _General, the Empire is corrupt, and I wish you could see that, too.<EOP>
<A10>: I agree that Kefka is corrupt.
But Kefka is not the Empire.<EOP>
I will not turn against my people solely because of the actions of one man.

[caption #3242]
Mog: Good to see you again, kupo!<EOP>
Need my help, kupo?
<C> Welcome to the team, buddy!
<C> No, you'd better stay here

Your team already looks pretty crowded, kupo.
I may be small, but I don't think I'll fit, kupo!

Antinomia: Final Fantasy VI - v1.0.0 - Fast Moon

======================
BACKGROUND
======================

Antinomia (n.) - The state of two laws or principles arrived at through good faith being mutually at odds.

The intent of this hack is to elevate General Leo to a deuteragonist role and periodically shift the focus from the main party to him to explore the events on the Imperial side in parallel with the main casts' actions (kind of like what FF8 did with Laguna).  The overall story progression and mechanics remain mostly the same, but utilize an expanded ROM and dialogue bank for dozens of new cutscenes and events to expand upon what's already there, for all characters, not just Leo.

======================
INSTALLATION
======================

- Base ROM: Final Fantasy III (U) (V1.0)
- Not compatible with any patches that alter game dialogue due to custom dialogue addressing.
- Your mileage may vary on patches that alter game mechanics, depending on what memory was altered.

=====================
NEW FEATURES
=====================

- Leo's sprite recolored to more closely match his menu portrait
- Leo can now become a permanent party member... OR NOT, depending on player choices.
- Mog is now a temporarily-recruitable guest character to open a permanent slot in the roster for Leo.
- Two new events added to the World of Balance featuring Leo as a playable character
- Brand new intro event to the World of Ruin
- Brand new re-recruitment event for Leo in World of Ruin
- Shadow becomes permanently recruitable in the World of Balance
- Dozens of new or expanded cutscenes for Leo and other characters
- Brand new retranslation of much of the original script.  Woolsey was used as a base and his translation was kept for lines that were "close enough" or whose localization didn't detract from the original intent.  The remainder of the script has been relocalized and refreshed.
- Spell, item, monster, and ability names updated to be consistent with modern naming schemes in the series, provided there were enough characters to fit the name (e.g., even though "Firaga" will fit in 6 letters, "Blizzaga" and "Thundaga" will not, so for consistency's sake, they have all remained "Fire 3", "Ice 3", and "Bolt 3").
- Evasion glitch patched. The Goggles no longer do nothing.
- Several new pieces of music
- New sidequest for additional stat gains

Biggs: So that's the town? <D$18><OP$12><EOP>
Wedge: Hard to believe an Esper's been found frozen there, 1000 years after the War of the Magi_ <D$18><OP$12>

[caption #1]
Biggs: Think it's just another hoax?
Wedge: Maybe_ <D$18><OP$12><EOP>
But if they've sent HER along with us, this might be the real deal. <D$18><OP$12>

[caption #2]
Biggs: This woman who was born with magical powers_ <D$18><OP$12><EOP>
I heard she fried 50 of our Magitek Armored soldiers in under 3 minutes. <D$18><OP$12>

[caption #3]
Wedge: Not to worry. The Slave Crown on her head robs her of all conscious thought. She'll follow orders. <D$18><OP$12>

[caption #4]
Wedge: We'll approach from the east.
Move out! <D$0C><OP$12>

[caption #5]
 Long ago, the War of the Magi
     reduced the world to a
scorched wasteland, and magic
     simply ceased to exist. <E$FF><OP$12>

[caption #6]
1000 years have passed_ Iron,
gunpowder, and steam engines
  have been rediscovered, and
     high technology reigns_ <E$FF><OP$12>

[caption #7]
    But there are some who
  would enslave the world by
reviving the dread destructive
    force known as [magic.] <E$FF><OP$12>

[caption #8]
        Can it be that those
  in power are on the verge of
       repeating a senseless
        and deadly mistake? <E$2A><OP$12>

[caption #9]
An eerie glow surrounds you.<EOP>
Want info about Save Points?
 <C> Yes

[caption #10]
Wedge: Let's put her on point.
No sense taking any risks.
Forward!

[caption #11]
Wedge: The Esper's gotta be in here.
Move out!

[caption #12]
Guard: Imperial Magitek Armor?
Not even Narshe's safe anymore!

[caption #13]
Guard: Machine-riding,
self-important swine!
Take this!

[caption #14]
Guard: Narshe's freedom depends on us!

[caption #15]
Wedge: According to our source, the frozen Esper was found in a new mine shaft.
_Maybe this one_

[caption #16]
Biggs: I'll handle this.
Stand back!

[caption #17]
Guard: We've got 'em trapped, now!

[caption #18]
Guard: We must defend the mines!

[caption #19]
Locked.

[caption #20]
Girl: Where am I_?

[caption #21]
Old Man: Whoa!
And I only just removed the crown!
<EOP>
Girl: _head_hurts_

[caption #22]
Old Man: Easy! This is a Slave Crown. The others had complete control over you while you were wearing it.

[caption #23]
Girl: I can't remember a thing_
Old Man: Don't worry.
It'll all come back to you_in time, that is.<EOP>

[caption #24]
My name_

Old Man: Impressive!
You've got a strong spirit to reclaim even that much of yourself so fast.

[caption #25]
Soldier: Open up!
Hand over the girl with the Magitek Armor!

[caption #26]
Soldier: Open this door!
We want that girl!
She's an officer of the Empire!

[caption #27]
<A0>: Empire_?
Magitek Armor_?

[caption #28]
Old Man: Look,
I have to get you out of here!
They're not going to listen to reason.

[caption #29]
Old Man: Over here!

A mysterious young woman, controlled by the Empire, and born with the gift of magic__

[caption #33]
Got her!

[caption #34]
She's up there!

[caption #35]
Kefka: My sweet little magic 
user_! Uweee, he, he! With this Slave Crown I'll practically OWN you!!

[caption #36]
Kefka: What's taking so long?!  Why hasn't the squad I sent to Narshe reported back yet? <E$08><OP$12>

[caption #37]
Kefka: Where's my magic user?!
Where's my Esper?!

[caption #38]
Cid: This is my finest work.
These Magitek converters combine the power of magic with machines_

[caption #39]
Gestahl: With our new-found power, nothing can stand in our way!<EOP>
Hurrah!!!
Long live Emperor Gestahl!!!

[caption #40]
Old Man: Took you long enough!
How goes the robbing and plundering trade?

[caption #41]
<A1>: I PREFER the term treasure hunting!<EOP>
Old Man: Ha!
Semantic nonsense!
<A1>: There's a HUGE difference!

[caption #42]
<A1>: Anyway, were you the one who sent for me?<EOP>
Old Man: Yeah.
There's a girl I'd like you to meet.

[caption #43]
<A1>: You mean the girl with the magical powers?

[caption #44]
Old Man: The town's guard is pursuing her even as we speak.<EOP>
I know this town is capable of resisting the Empire.<EOP>
But our pride in our own self-sufficiency has prevented us from joining the Returners, the underground resistance.<EOP>
Even if I try to explain that the girl was only being controlled by the Empire, they won't listen_

[caption #45]
<A1>: All right_
I think we'd better help her_

[caption #46]
Old Man: Agreed.
Make your way first to Figaro, and talk to the king.

[caption #47]
Treasure hunter and trail-worn traveler, searching the world over for relics of the past_

<C> No

[caption #54]
You'll fight using 3 different groups. Press the Y Button to switch between them.<EOP>
Your job is to defeat the commander of the guards before his men reach <A0>. Save her, or else_

[caption #55]
<A0>: Unh_

[caption #56]
<A1>: Thanks, Moogles!
We're in your debt!

<A1>: Your memories_ _<D>
Don't worry, I swear I'll protect you!!

[caption #63]
Man: You mean, THIS young woman_?!

[caption #64]
<A0>: Who_are you?

[caption #65]
Man: Oh, my apologies!

[caption #66]
Man: How rude of me to turn my back to a lady!

[caption #67]
The young king of Figaro Castle, ally to the Empire, and a master designer of machinery_

[caption #68]
<A4>: I am <A4>, King of Figaro.

[caption #69]
<A1>: Surprised someone like me knows a king?

[caption #70]
<A1>: Talk to you later!

[caption #71]
<A4>: So_you're an Imperial soldier! No problem. Figaro and the Gestahlian Empire are allies!<EOP>
Please, relax while you're here.
It's not in my blood to harm a lady.

[caption #72]
<A0>: Why are you putting so much effort into helping me?
Is it because of my_abilities?

[caption #73]
<A4>: I'll give you 3 reasons:
First of all, your beauty has captivated me!<EOP>
Second_I'm dying to know if I'm your type_

[caption #74]
I guess your_abilities_would be a distant 3rd.

[caption #75]
<A0>: __? <D>
What does that mean?

[caption #76]
<A4>: Guess my technique's getting a bit rusty_

[caption #77]
<A4>: Come find me when you feel rested.

[caption #78]
<A0>: I see_I suppose a normal girl would have felt something from those words. <D>
But I'm hardly_normal_

[caption #79]
Feel free to wander about.

[caption #80]
Go see the King!

[caption #81]
Weapons and items manufactured here are sent to South Figaro.

[caption #82]
I've read that long ago, people were able to use a power called [magic].<EOP>
People who used magic were called [mages].

[caption #83]
Scholars the world over are doing research on magic.
Even though there's no such thing_

[caption #84]
Ancient texts I'm studying speak of a [1000 year-old city beneath the sand.]<EOP>
I wonder what this means, <EOP>
[_when the queen stands and takes 5 steps_]

[caption #85]
I heard the Empire is using something called [magic]_

[caption #86]
The Empire has smashed the 3 cities on the southern continent. Just a matter of time 'til they come up here_

[caption #87]
Gestahl has harnessed the power of magic.
Guess he's gonna conquer the world or something now.

[caption #88]
<A4> loves women of all kinds.  Young or old, if you're female he'll put the moves on you.

[caption #89]
His highness said he'd marry me when I get older!

[caption #90]
I'm gonna marry the king!

[caption #91]
He recently tried to hit on the high priestess_
Surely, he's_talked to you?

Contact a supervisor.
From: Development Team.

[caption #96]
These thieves have been
terrorizing the vicinity.
Stay away from 'em!

[caption #97]
I demand to see <A4>!
How dare they keep us in this stinking pit!

[caption #98]
Phew! _Hey, do you think I stink?

[caption #99]
Relax, they're just blowing off steam. But I'm telling you, there's no sense keeping us here!<EOP>
We're just small potatos compared to the real threat lurking out there! And King <A4> knows it!

[caption #100]
I'm Lone Wolf, the pickpocket!

[caption #101]
Matron: <A4>'s at it again!? He hits on anything that moves!

[caption #102]
Matron: <A4> has a twin brother. He was such a nice boy, always thinking of his family_

[caption #103]
Youth: Brother,
What's wrong with father?
What's all this talk of his successor?<EOP>
<A4>: Are you blind?
Look how thin his face has become!

[caption #104]
Youth: ?__What is it?

[caption #105]
Youth: Brother!

[caption #106]
Youth: Tears__?!

[caption #107]
<A4>'s twin brother, who traded the throne for his own freedom_

[caption #108]
Matron: Yes_
His name is <A5>. I'm sure he's grown into a fine man by now.<EOP>
He was so small and meek compared to <A4> when he left.
I wonder what he's like now?

[caption #109]
Chancellor: The whole business of the succession was so repugnant to <A5>, the King's brother, that__<EOP>
__he fled the castle forever. The succession was settled with a coin toss_

[caption #110]
Merchant: I can't take money from the King!<EOP>
<A4>: Look, don't you have a family?
Don't worry about it and just take it.

[caption #111]
Merchant: Sir <A5>, I can't take your money!<EOP>
<A5>: Take it!
Haven't you heard? My brother says I'm a notorious spendthrift!

[caption #112]
<A4>: I hear you've already overthrown the three southern nations.
So what brings you here?<EOP>
Trooper: That's for us to know!

[caption #113]
Sir Kefka!?
What on earth do_<EOP>
Kefka: Outta my way!

[caption #114]
<A4>: Well?
How do you like my castle?

[caption #115]
King <A4>!
Someone from the Empire to see you!

[caption #116]
<A4>: Probably Kefka!

[caption #117]
Kefka: Phooey!
Emperor Gestahl's stupid orders!

[caption #118]
Kefka: <A4>, you pinhead!
Why do you have to live in the middle of nowhere?<EOP>
When I said I wanted the girl back, I didn't mean I wanted to trudge out here PERSONALLY!<EOP>
My body isn't built for this kind of grunt work.

[caption #119]
Kefka: Ahem_there's SAND on my boots!

[caption #120]
Soldiers: Yes, Sir!
All set, Sir!

[caption #121]
Kefka: Idiots!

[caption #122]
<A4>: I thought we were allies! What are you doing in my domain?<EOP>
Trooper: Allies? The Empire and this back-water, two-bit kingdom?!

[caption #123]
<A4>: What brings Kefka, court mage of Emperor Gestahl, into our lowly presence?<EOP>
Kefka: A girl of no importance recently escaped from us. We heard she found refuge here_

[caption #124]
<A4>: Hmm_this wouldn't have anything to do with this [witch] everyone's been whispering about, would it?<EOP>
Kefka: Lies!
She_merely stole something of minor value.
Is she here?

[caption #125]
<A4>: That's a tough one!

[caption #126]
<A4>: You see, there're more girls here than grains of sand out there. I can't keep track of 'em all!<EOP>
Kefka: I'd hate to be you if we find out you're lying_
Mwa, ha!

[caption #127]
Kefka: I truly hope nothing happens to your precious Figaro_!

[caption #128]
<A1>: I'd say that guy's missing a few buttons_
<A4>: _
Where's <A0>?

[caption #129]
<A4>: Take her to her room_

[caption #130]
<A4>: I'd love to chat with you, but the Chancellor and I must plan our strategy.<EOP>
Sometimes I hate being a king!
If you'll excuse me.

[caption #131]
<A1>: Follow me.

[caption #132]
<A1>: Sorry if we've made you think we only have a business interest in you.  I'm_<EOP>
<A0>: You're <A1>, right? <A4> told me about you.
Is it true you're a thief?

[caption #133]
<A1>: That's TREASURE HUNTER!

[caption #134]
<A1>: On the surface, <A4> pretends to support the Empire.<EOP>
The truth is, he's collaborating with the Returners, an organization opposed to the Empire.<EOP>
I am his contact with that group_

[caption #135]
<A1>: The old man you met in Narshe is one of us.<EOP>
<A0>: Empire_but I'm a soldier of the Empire_!

[caption #136]
<A1>: Not anymore!
You were only being controlled by them.
Things are different now.

[caption #137]
<A0>: I don't understand_
What should I do?
My head_hurts_

[caption #138]
<A1>: What you do from here is up to you.<EOP>
You haven't had much time to think about it yet.
But I'm sure you'll find your way eventually_

[caption #139]
<A0>: Up to me_<D>
But_how do I decide?

[caption #140]
<A4>: _?<EOP>
What the_?!

[caption #141]
<A4>: What's happening?<EOP>
Soldier: It's the Empire!
It's Kefka!

[caption #142]
<A4>: What are you doing?

[caption #143]
Kefka: Bring me the girl. Now!
<A4>: I told you she's not here!<EOP>
Kefka: Then_

<A4>: Do it like we planned_<EOP>
Soldier: Yes, Sir!

[caption #147]
Kefka: Changed your mind_?

[caption #148]
<A4>: I guess I have no choice_

[caption #149]
<A4>: Or maybe I do!

[caption #150]
Kefka: Oh my!
It appears Good King <A4> is valiantly abandoning his kingdom!<EOP>
How utterly delightful!

<A0>: Were those_bad people?<E$04><OP$12>
I_ <D>I'm scared_

[caption #161]
<A4>: <A0>,
there's someone I'd like you to meet_!

[caption #162]
<A1>: We're members of a resistance organization called the Returners.<EOP>
<A4>: Our mentor, Banon, would certainly like to meet you.<EOP>
[Magic] is going to be the key to winning this war.

[caption #163]
<A0>: [Magic]_

[caption #164]
<A4>: <A0> has magical powers. That Esper seemed to_react to her. Can there be some connection?<EOP>
<A0>: I haven't the foggiest! It just seems natural to me that I have the use of this power_

[caption #165]
<A4>: But no HUMAN is born with the powers you seem to have, and_

[caption #166]
<A4>: I apologize.
<A0>: What should I do_?<EOP>
<A4>: I'm sure the Empire is after you and the secrets to your powers_<EOP>
If they get their hands on you again, the world's finished_<EOP>
<A0>, you want to understand your own powers, right?

[caption #167]
<A4>: That's why I'd like to consult with Banon and shed some light on this.<EOP>
<A0>: __

[caption #168]
<A1>: Please_

[caption #169]
<A4>: OK!
To the south there's a cave that leads to South Figaro.

[caption #170]
This cave leads to South Figaro. However, I cannot let you through at this time.

[caption #171]
Soldier: King <A4>!
Where are you headed?<EOP>
<A4>: Through the cave, and eastward to South Figaro, then north to the Returner hideout.<EOP>
<A4>: Return to the castle, and tell the others we're safe.<EOP>
Soldier: Yes, Sir!
Take care!

Welcome to South Figaro!

[caption #179]
You'll find lots of excellent weapons, armor and relics in our shops.

[caption #180]
Did you hear?
Figaro Castle sank into the sand!<EOP>
You couldn't find it even if you knew where to look!

[caption #181]
Mt. Kolts is to the east.

[caption #182]
Beyond Mt. Kolts you'll find the Sabre mountain range.

[caption #183]
Equip relics to gain a variety of abilities!<EOP>
These double my walking speed!

[caption #184]
My husband, Duncan, is a
world-famous martial artist!<EOP>
He's taking his disciples to
Mt. Kolts for meditation and training.

[caption #185]
<A5>, where's Vargas?
Where's my husband?

[caption #186]
<A5>: Master is gone_
It was Vargas_

[caption #187]
Duncan's Wife: Why would Vargas do such a thing_<EOP>
Fortunately, my husband taught his most secret techniques to you.

[caption #188]
<A5>: For 10 years you've treated me like a son. I am eternally grateful!

[caption #189]
_.

[caption #190]
<A1>: At the very least you could give me a response_

[caption #191]
<A4>: Stand back!
He seems vaguely familiar_
Wait a minute_!

[caption #192]
He owes allegiance to no one. 
Not a soul has seen the true
face behind his mask_

[caption #193]
<A4>: That's <A3>_!
He'd slit his mama's throat for a nickel!
He's a ruthless assassin.

[caption #194]
<A1>: We should steer clear of him, just to be safe.

[caption #195]
<A3>: Leave us.
The dog eats strangers_

[caption #196]
The guy at the counter_
He's kinda creepy_

[caption #197]
That guy at the counter_HEY! Where'd he go?

[caption #198]
One of Duncan's students looks a lot like you.

[caption #199]
So Duncan's dead.  That's too bad.

[caption #200]
Duncan trained his son, Vargas, in the martial arts, but he complained he wasn't progressing fast enough.

[caption #201]
The house in the northern part of town belongs to our wealthiest citizen.

[caption #202]
The Empire's been invading one town after the next.
We're not safe here!

[caption #203]
Figaro castle turned on the Empire?!<EOP>
Aw man, I don't want to get dragged into the war, too.

[caption #204]
If we make the Empire mad,
they'll attack us, too!

[caption #205]
This town's defenses are solid!
Even with their Magitek Armor, the Empire won't be able to invade that easily.

[caption #206]
Attack from the east.
That way, <D>__?!<EOP>
Oh! Wh, what do you want? How rude of you to barge in while I'm trying to write a letter!

[caption #207]
Ahem_
Naturally, I am the wealthiest man in this town.

[caption #208]
Oh, what have I done?!
How could I be so tempted by money that I'd pass intel to the Empire?

Wind the clock!
Wind the clock!<EOP>
Uh, that was just a jump-rope rhyme!

[caption #212]
Has war really begun?
I'd better return home_

[caption #213]
The Imperial Troops have turned this house into their headquarters.

[caption #214]
There's always a nasty draft in this room. Where's it coming from?

[caption #215]
I don't like strangers.
Bring me some cider, and maybe I'll talk to you.

[caption #216]
What?!
No cider?!

[caption #217]
Hurumph_DOG!

[caption #218]
Ah! Cider!
Glug, glug, _<EOP>
Huh? Secret passage?
Well, there is one that leads to the rich man's house.

[caption #219]
Go downstairs and give my grandson the password. It's_uh, umm_
I forget!

[caption #220]
My grandfather was a servant for the rich family at the north end of town.

[caption #221]
Only people dressed as merchants may pass through.

[caption #222]
Merchant, right?
You may proceed.

[caption #223]
The password is_
<C> [Rose bud]
<C> [Courage]
<C> [Failure]

You're an Imperial spy!
Can't fool me!

[caption #225]
Secret entrance.

Outta the way!
I gotta get this cider over to the old man!
That's my job!<EOP>
Now scram!

[caption #228]
I'm off work.
Get lost!

[caption #229]
Are kids allowed in here?

Oh, all right_

[caption #230]
Hey you!
Come to steal my cider?

[caption #231]
You thief!

[caption #232]
Took the old man's cider!

[caption #233]
The ship isn't going anywhere.

[caption #234]
Imperial troops are milling about.
Gotta jam without being seen!

[caption #235]
Use caution.

[caption #236]
<A4>: Hm_
What's that smell_?

His favorite_

[caption #238]
<A4>: And this_
His favorite tea_

They were his favorite!

[caption #241]
<A4>: Excuse me_

[caption #242]
<A4>: Do you know the man who lives here?

[caption #243]
Man: Of course. He left a couple of days ago after he heard Master Duncan was slain.
He headed into the mountains.<EOP>
I heard Duncan's son, Vargas, is missing as well.
I have a bad feeling about this_

[caption #244]
<A4>: So <A5> was Duncan's student_
To think he's been in the care of someone so renowned_

[caption #245]
Scum!
You're Returners!

[caption #246]
Is that you, <A5>?

[caption #247]
Vargas: So you're with <A5>, huh?

[caption #248]
<A1>: Who're YOU?

[caption #249]
<A1>: Were you the one sneaking around before?
Vargas: Who cares?!

[caption #250]
<A0>: It was you, wasn't it? The student who killed Master Duncan and fled.

[caption #251]
Vargas: Hmph, it's not like the likes of you could catch me.<EOP>
You're going to rue the day you ran into me!!

[caption #252]
<A4>: <A5>?
Is he here?

[caption #253]
<A4>: <A5>!!!

[caption #254]
<A5>: Big brother?

[caption #255]
<A1>: This is your... LITTLE brother?!

[caption #256]
<A0>: [Little]_brother?
I was sure he was one of Vargas's bears_

[caption #257]
<A5>: Bear?!

[caption #258]
<A5>: Bear, huh? I like the sound of that!

[caption #259]
<A5>: Anyway, brother, what are you doing here?
<A4>: We're on the way to the Sabre Mountains.<EOP>
<A5>: To the Returner hideout, no doubt?

[caption #260]
<A5>: So things are finally starting to happen! I've been secretly watching things from afar.<EOP>
I was afraid Figaro was going to turn into an Imperial puppet state.

[caption #261]
<A4>: Our time to strike back has arrived.<EOP>
I can tell the old advisors are sick of going along with the Empire, too.

[caption #262]
<A5>: Think a [bear] like me could help you in your fight?

[caption #263]
<A4>: You'd_join us?
<A5>_!!

[caption #264]
<A5>: I think Duncan would rest easier if he knew his disciple played a part in bringing peace to the world.

[caption #265]
<A1>: Let's get going!

[caption #266]
King <A4>!
This way, please!

[caption #267]
Did you speak with Banon?

[caption #268]
Not even the Empire'd think of looking here for us!

[caption #269]
Aha!

[caption #270]
Welcome!

[caption #271]
Thank you!

[caption #272]
Take a nap?
<C> Yes

250 GP for a Chocobo ride!
Well?
<C> Yes
<C> No

[caption #275]
Banon: So is this the girl who reacted to the frozen Esper?
<A0>: Esper_?<EOP>
<A4>: Seemed the Empire had complete control over her.

[caption #276]
Banon: Carrier pigeons brought word that she wiped out 50 of the Empire's best soldiers in a few minutes.

[caption #277]
<A0>: I didn't_!!

[caption #278]
<A1>: <A0>!
<A4>: Master Banon, don't be so harsh!

[caption #279]
Banon: Don't deny it!

[caption #280]
<A4>: Master Banon!
We brought the girl with us.

[caption #281]
Banon: Perhaps you've heard this story? Once, when people were pure and innocent,<EOP>
there was a box they were told never to open. But one man went and opened it anyway.<EOP>
He unleashed all the evils of the world: envy_ <D>greed_ <D>pride_ <D>violence_ <D>control_<EOP>
All that was left in the box was a single ray of light: Hope.

[caption #282]
<A0>: __
Banon: Whatever might have happened, don't think of your own abilities as a curse_<EOP>
And you are that last ray of light, our only hope_

[caption #283]
<A4>: Master Banon!

[caption #284]
Banon: I'm so tired_
Let me rest a while.

[caption #285]

        2000 GP inside!

[caption #286]

        Found Hi-Potion!

[caption #287]

        Found Hi-Ether!

[caption #288]

        Found Remedy!

[caption #289]
We're a small organization now, but our membership is starting to soar.

[caption #290]
Banon: <A0>_
Talk to everyone here, heed their advice.

[caption #291]
Master Banon?
He went outside a moment ago.

[caption #292]
Welcome back!
Glad you're okay.

[caption #293]
Welcome back!

[caption #294]
Is Master Banon well?

[caption #295]
My wounds are healing.

[caption #296]
The Empire is wiping out Returners everywhere.
We have to discover some means of fighting back, or_

[caption #297]
<A1>: The Empire took away someone precious to me. I've hated the Empire ever since_<EOP>
As long as the Empire continues to do as it pleases, it'll just create more people like me.<EOP>
That's why I joined the Returners.

[caption #298]
Someone dropped a scrap of paper_<EOP>
<C> Toss it in the trash.
<C> Leave it there.

[caption #299]
Banon: Who did this?
Who left this piece of paper here?

[caption #300]
<A0>: But_I don't have anyone I consider [precious]_<EOP>
<A1>: That's not entirely true.<EOP>
On the contrary, I'm sure there's someone who considers YOU precious! So do it for them_

[caption #301]
<A4>: I know it's selfish of us to ask for your help_<EOP>
If we force you, we're no different than the Empire_<EOP>
So we want you to make up your own mind.

[caption #302]
<A5>: I don't really understand what's going on_but I do know my brother is always right.<EOP>
He's always looked out for me. You can trust him, <A0>_

[caption #303]
But don't you DARE tell him I said that!

[caption #304]
Banon: Have you made a decision?<EOP>
Will you become our last ray of hope?
<C> Yes
<C> No

[caption #305]
Banon: You will? Really!!

[caption #306]
<A0>: But_ <D>
I'm scared_

[caption #307]
Banon: I see_

[caption #308]
Banon: I thought as much_

[caption #309]
Banon: You're sure about this?

[caption #310]
I understand your unease.
But even as we speak, innocent lives are being lost_<EOP>
Please. We need your abilities.
This relic will keep you safe.<EOP>
     Received [Genji Glove]!

[caption #311]
We truly need your help!

[caption #312]
Please join us in our battle!

[caption #313]
Banon: The person who possesses this relic need not fear harm.

[caption #314]
Banon: Please, <A0>_
I'd like you to take it with you.

[caption #315]
<A0>: What is this??? <D>

[caption #316]
Banon: If everyone works together we'll be successful.
Never give up hope!

[caption #317]
Banon: A lucky charm. Take it!<EOP>
     Received [Gauntlet]!

[caption #318]
Banon: I have a plan!
Please get everyone together!

[caption #319]
<A0>: Hope_
How can anyone put their hope in me?

[caption #320]
S_South Figaro_

[caption #321]
What? WHAT IS IT?

[caption #322]
Banon: What's going on?
What happened?

[caption #323]
<A0>: He's badly wounded!

[caption #324]
Banon: Someone did a number on him_

[caption #325]
E_Empire_took South Figaro_
Coming_this way_unnnh_

[caption #326]
Banon: They've found us_
We haven't a moment to lose!

[caption #327]
<A4>: <A1>!<EOP>
<A1>: I know_
[Someone] has to sneak into South Figaro and slow the Empire down, right?<EOP>
<A4>: This's right up your alley! Good luck!

[caption #328]
<A1>: <A0>_
Please wait for me_
And_please_<EOP>
_don't let a lecherous young king, who shall remain nameless, near you!
<A4>: <A1>!!!

[caption #329]
<A5>: Big brother_
Aren't you EVER going to grow up?

[caption #330]
Banon: What're we going to do?<EOP>
<A4>: We'll escape down the Lete River, and make our way to Narshe. I want to see that Esper for myself_<EOP>
Banon: Right. There's a raft by the back entrance.
It's a gamble, but we're fresh out of options_

[caption #331]
<A4>: You're in danger here. Come with us to Narshe.<EOP>
It'll probably even be a good opportunity for you to understand your abilities_

[caption #332]
Banon: We've no time to dilly-dally. Let's make for Narshe!

[caption #333]
We'll handle things here_
Please leave for Narshe!

[caption #334]
Please take care of Master Banon.

[caption #335]
The Lete River runs through some underground caverns.

[caption #336]
Banon: We all know that the Empire is using Magitek power in battle.<EOP>
What we don't know is how Gestahl has managed to resurrect magic. That's the main point.

[caption #337]
<A4>: I had <A1> look into the rumor that the Empire is forcing the world's finest scholars to study Espers.

[caption #338]
<A1>: The attack on Narshe was over an Esper, too_

[caption #339]
Banon: Right_

[caption #340]
<A0>: You mean there's some connection between Espers and Magitek?<EOP>
Banon: I can only recall one thing linking Espers with Magitek power_

[caption #341]
<A4>: You don't mean_<EOP>
Banon: Indeed!
The ancient War of the Magi_

[caption #342]
[No!]
[It can't be!]

[caption #343]
<A1>: My Grandma used to tell me stories about magical machines_
Could they have been true?

[caption #344]
<A4>: Could that ancient tragedy be playing out once again_<EOP>
Banon: It's hard to say. That all happened 1000 years ago.<EOP>
But historical studies have provided a number of conflicting and frightening theories_<EOP>
According to one theory, humans and machines were infused with powers drained from Espers_

[caption #345]
<A0>: Is that what Magitek power is_?

[caption #346]
<A4>: We can only fight Magitek enemies with Magitek weapons_<EOP>
Banon: No! Then we would only repeat the mistakes of the War of the Magi!
<A4>: Then what do we do?<EOP>
Banon: I was thinking perhaps we could talk to the Esper_
<A1>: Talk to it?!

[caption #347]
Banon: It's risky, but if we have <A0> react with that Esper once again, it might just wake up_<EOP>
<A4>: I wonder if that's wise_?

[caption #348]
Banon: I'm not saying it's a certainty.
Regardless,
we need <A0>'s help.

[caption #349]
<A1>: <A0>_

[caption #350]
<A0>: I'll give it a try!<EOP>
<A5>: This all went in one ear and out the other, but I'm in! Sounds fun!

[caption #351]
Emergency!
Master Banon_

[caption #352]
Banon: What? <D>
What's that noise?

[caption #353]
Uwaaaa!
The Empire's invading!

[caption #354]
Urgh_uhnn_

[caption #355]

Sleep talking?

[caption #357]
Here we go!
This raft'll take us to Narshe!

[caption #358]
Hop aboard the raft?
<C> Yes
<C> No

[caption #359]
Fleeing the Empire's troops,
Banon, <A4> and <A0> ride the rapids toward Narshe.
But the going won't be easy_

[caption #360]
Head toward Narshe, but protect Banon at all costs.<EOP>
If Banon falls in battle, your journey's over.

[caption #361]
Which way?
    <C> (Straight)

 <C> (Left)      <C> (Right)

[caption #362]

<A4> and <A0> race toward Narshe while protecting Banon_<EOP>
_but what about <A5>, who was swallowed by the raging waters_?
And_<EOP>
_how is <A1> faring, after having penetrated the Empire's defenses in South Figaro_<EOP>
Is all going according to plan_?

<A1>: Nuts!
Gotta get to Narshe on the fly_

[caption #370]
<A1> has worked hard to stymie the efforts of the Imperial troops. But now he desperately needs to escape_

[caption #371]
Halt!

[caption #372]
<A1>: Ouch!!
I gotta steal me some new clothes, fast!!

[caption #373]
Back inside!

[caption #374]
Gotta get moving!
The attack on Narshe is imminent. Who knows when they'll give the order?

[caption #375]
Imperial soldiers are pigs!
Green Suits live to brawl_

[caption #376]
<A1>: I've seen her before_
Of course! She's one of the Empire's generals!

[caption #377]
Groomed by the Empire as a
Magitek Knight, none have seen 
the woman behind the general_

[caption #378]
Guard: This's what happens to traitors!

[caption #379]
Guard: So even the mighty General <A6> has fallen.

[caption #380]
<A6>: Not as far as the likes of you who prefer to bully innocent civilians_
Guard: Hold your tongue!

[caption #381]
<A6>: Isn't it true Kefka is planning to poison the people of Doma, to the east?
Guard: Shuddap!

[caption #382]
Guard: Hmph. You're getting the axe tomorrow, anyway. Run your mouth while you still can.

[caption #383]
Keep a close eye on her!

[caption #384]
Yes, Sir!
I can go for days without sleep!

[caption #385]
<C> (Remove her chains?)
<C> (Just stand there and stare)

[caption #386]
<A6>: Aren't you a little short for a soldier?
<A1>: Huh? Oh, the uniform!

[caption #387]
<A6>: What do you hope to peddle down here?
<A1>: Oops! Forgot I was wearing these clothes.

[caption #388]
<A6>: And you are_

[caption #389]
<A1>: I'm with the Returners. Name's <A1>.<EOP>
<A6>: Returners!!! I see_
I am General <A6>_<EOP>
Or at least I was. Now I am nothing but a common traitor_

[caption #390]
<A1>: Let's go!
<A6>: !? You would take me with you?

[caption #391]
<A6>: No, it would be futile.
As you can see, I can barely walk as it is_

[caption #392]
<A6>: I am grateful, but_
Even if you were able to escape with me, it is unlikely you could protect me.<EOP>
It is better that I remain here and face my death with dignity.

[caption #393]
<A1>: I WILL protect you!

[caption #394]
<A1>: Trust me! You'll be fine!

[caption #395]
<A1>: Let's go!

[caption #396]
Soldier: _more soup_'n_

[caption #397]
Soldier: _'n some bread, too_
<D>Mumble <D> Mumble_

[caption #398]
<A6>: Wait.

[caption #399]
<A6>: This soldier may carry something to aid our escape_

[caption #400]
<A6>: Why are you helping me?
<A1>: You remind me of someone_

[caption #401]
<A1>: No, it's nothing.
I just want to, okay?!

[caption #402]
<A6>: This passage leads out.

[caption #403]
<A1>: Huh?
<A6>: Something is emerging from the wall!!

[caption #404]
<A1>: Whew!!!
Looks like we're in the clear!

[caption #405]
<A1>: What IS that noise?

[caption #406]
I hear the lady general betrayed the Empire and got locked up!<EOP>
Now with no one in charge here, we can do whatever we want!

[caption #407]
Oh crap!
It's my shift to guard the passage under the northern mansion.<EOP>
Eh, whatever. I'm already this late, a little more won't hurt.

[caption #408]
I heard there are 2 secret tunnels under the rich man's house.<EOP>
One leads out of town, the other to one of these houses_

[caption #409]
Thanks to our informer, this town fell instantly!

[caption #410]
Rascals!
Knock it off!

[caption #411]
<C> (Take off the disguise?)
<C> (But I like these clothes.)

[caption #412]
Lower ranking soldiers are weak but like to brawl.<EOP>
They leave themselves so wide open you could steal the clothes off their backs.

[caption #413]
Hmph!

[caption #414]
Avoid the armored soldiers! They'll kill you just for talking to them!

[caption #415]
Hey, lady_didn't you just bust in here wearing Magitek armor?

[caption #416]
Banon: Please wait!

[caption #417]
Get out of here!
If you don't_

[caption #418]
<A4>: Hold on.
I'm King <A4> of Figaro_
Guard: Liar!!!

[caption #419]
Banon: For heaven's sake_
<A4>: This is why I hate dealing with men.
He won't even listen!<EOP>
<A0>: I'm sorry, it's because of me_

[caption #420]
Arvis: Master Banon! King <A4>!
_and <A0>!!!

[caption #421]
Banon: Arvis!
What's happening here in Narshe?<EOP>
Arvis: The town won't side with the Empire or the Returners.
They just won't listen.<EOP>
But with you and the King of Figaro here, then maybe_

[caption #422]
<A4>: First, how are your people doing?<EOP>
Arvis: They're pretty anxious about that Esper in the mines.

[caption #423]
Banon: We believe this young woman is capable of giving us some answers about that Esper.<EOP>
Arvis: The people are naturally curious about it as well.<EOP>
Depending on how we handle this, they may become more accepting of <A0>_

[caption #424]
<A4>: That Esper is either going to save us_or dig us an early grave_

[caption #425]
<A0>: When <A1> first helped me, he fiddled with something right around here.

[caption #426]
<A4>: He told me. Twist this outcropping here and_

[caption #427]
<A4>: Goodness_
<A0>: What's that_?<EOP>
<A4>: I heard there was a place where applicants for the city guard had their strength tested. This must be it_<EOP>
If we follow that light we should reach the other side safely.<EOP>
If we become surrounded, we need to [tag] the red light in order to proceed_

Soldier: Who goes there?!

[caption #480]
Soldier A: Shhhh!
Do I always have to tell you to keep it down?!
You're hopeless_!<EOP>
Soldier A: Sometimes I feel like General Leo is the only thing keeping us from becoming Kefka's disposable pawns. <EOP>
I really hope nothing happens to him.
Soldier B: Yeah, no kidding.

[caption #481]
<A5>: What the_?
Where'd these soldiers come from?

[caption #482]
Commander: You two! We're about to storm Doma Castle_<EOP>
You will join the assault team!

[caption #484]
Soldier: Rogue!!!

[caption #485]
This's an Imperial base.
Too many soldiers_

[caption #486]
Soldier A: Hey, have you heard?
Soldier B: Oh, you mean_<EOP>
Soldier A: Shhh! Quiet down.
If Kefka catches us, we're toast.

[caption #487]
Soldier A: It seems like Kefka is trying to drive General Leo out of the army and make himself a general.<EOP>
Soldier B: Don't even joke about that!
If that happens, I'm outta here. <EOP>
I don't want to end up like one of those poor saps he had his witch fry.

[caption #488]
Soldier A: Shhhhh!
What if he hears you?
You'll be jailed!<EOP>
Soldier B: Alright, already!

Kefka: Hey, you!
You keeping a sharp lookout, hm?<EOP>
Soldier A: Yes, Sir.
You are Lord Kefka, correct?
How are you today, Sir?<EOP>
Kefka: Please!
Save your petty small talk!<EOP>
If you can't even handle lookout duty, I can find [other] uses for you!

[caption #491]
Soldier B: Hmph!
Who'd ever follow orders from the likes of you?!<EOP>
Soldier B: _One of these days I'm gonna force-feed that guy the dirt off the bottom of General Leo's boots.

[caption #492]
Soldier: General Leo.
I'm sorry to report that the Commander has fallen_

[caption #493]
Leo: _Call off the attack.
There will be no more lives sacrificed today.

[caption #494]
Soldier: But, General!
I'm ready to lay my life down at any time for the Empire!

[caption #495]
Leo: You're from Maranda, right?<EOP>
Soldier: Y_yes Sir. Why?

[caption #496]
Leo: And you have family there? Are you asking that I travel to your home and present them your effects?<EOP>
What would I say to them?
How could I even face them?<EOP>
You're a human being before you're a soldier. Don't be so eager to throw your life away.<EOP>
I'm sure Emperor Gestahl feels the same.

[caption #497]
Soldier: Yes, Sir!

[caption #498]
Soldier: General Leo!

[caption #499]

It is imperative I return to Vector immediately.

Leo: I must return home. I don't want any trouble here!<EOP>
Kefka: You loser, under your command this operation has been nothing BUT trouble!<EOP>
You've been trying to conquer Doma for three years now and what do you have to show for it?!

[caption #516]
Leo: This is a delicate operation, Kefka.<EOP>
Doma is an ancient country rich in history and culture.
It would be a travesty to destroy it.

[caption #517]
Kefka: That's right, you go be the hero and plead for the sake of a traitor.<EOP>
I'm sure that'll earn you a gold star on your spotless record.

[caption #518]
Kefka: Is the poison ready?
Soldier: But, General Leo said_<EOP>
Kefka: He's no longer here!
I'm in charge now. Hand it over!<EOP>
Soldier: Some of our people are prisoners inside the castle!
If they drink the water_<EOP>
Kefka: Who cares?!
We have no need for people who are stupid enough to get captured!

[caption #519]
That's inhuman!

[caption #520]
Kefka: Tch, noisy brat!
I'll give you something to cry about!

[caption #521]
Kefka: Persistent, aren't you?
You want me to rough you up that badly?

[caption #522]
Kefka: *pant* *pant*
You really don't know when to give up!

Kefka: Hmph!
You expect me to teach you a lesson all day? Next time I'll get you for sure!

Wait!!!

Kefka: Oh, gripe!
Hey, you! This is your problem now!

The greater our number,

<A2>: To the south is the Veldt. Dangerous creatures there.<EOP>
<A5>: And the Empire's right on our tails.<EOP>
<A2>: If we can slip through the Veldt, we can reach the town of Mobliz, to the east_

<A5>: <A3>!

[caption #738]
<A5>: Thanks for your help!
Let's join ranks again some time!

You came via Baren Falls?
Unbelievable! The river's been so swollen lately that no one can get out here!

Threw his own kid out, thinking it was a monster!

[caption #750]
This region's called the Veldt. Monsters from all over the world migrate here. Better watch yourself.

Yesterday while out hunting I thought I saw a kid running with the monsters. Maybe I was just seeing things_?

Heard about it?

If you had a helmet you could make it to Nikeah.

Too bad our underwater breathing device was stolen!

A wounded soldier stumbled into town.
I've tried to tend to him, but he isn't recovering_<EOP>
Only the letters coming from the town of Maranda are keeping him going_

There's a soldier in this house who's hurt really bad. So you gotta be quiet.

Gotta be quiet!

I'm a Marandan soldier, but the Empire invaded and conscripted us into their army.<EOP>
I didn't have any choice but to fight for them.<EOP>
I was sent to Doma to serve under General Leo. He's a decent man for an Imperial,<EOP>
but that didn't change the fact that he was still my captor.<EOP>
While he was off base, there was a plot to poison the Doman water supply. I couldn't do it. I ran_<EOP>
Imperial loyalist soldiers chased me, beat me, and left me for dead_ Now I can barely move_<EOP>
At this rate I doubt I'll ever see Lola's face again_<EOP>
There's a letter on the desk there.
Could you please bring it here?

[caption #762]
The number of Imperial troops marching the Marandan streets has increased,<EOP>
but otherwise I'm doing alright.<EOP>
Flowers are blooming in the garden, telling me spring is here.<EOP>
How are you doing?
I'm so worried. I wish I could fly to your side!<EOP>
Please just focus on getting better and don't exert yourself.
I think about you daily.<EOP>
Come home soon_

This is Nikeah, one of the world's few port towns.

We used to be a flourishing hub of trade.<EOP>
But thanks to the Empire's strict cargo checks, it's all slowed down.

[caption #804]
Now Doma is under Imperial control, too?

[caption #805]
Move along, now.
You're in the way!

[caption #806]
We're an island isolated from the rest of the continent.
You can only get here by boat.<EOP>
By the way_
What does [isolated] mean?

[caption #807]
Usually you can get here by following the coast from the north, but right now it's blocked by a rockslide.

The path leading north is now clear.

I promised her I'd protect her!

[caption #900]
<A4>: Let's split into two groups. <EOP>
One will go help <A0>, the other will remain here and defend Narshe.<EOP>
We can use Figaro Castle to reach the land to the west. We should be able to find clues in Kohlingen or Jidoor.

[caption #901]
Change party members?
<C> Yes
<C> No

[caption #902]
<A2>: A former Imperial soldier_<EOP>
But we've no choice.
We must help her!

It looked just like an Esper_

<A2>: We must help her!

[caption #906]
<A4>: I leave <A0> in your hands.

[caption #907]
<A5>: I'll take care of Narshe!
Hurry and go help <A0>!

[caption #908]
<A11>: <A11>_
<A11> do his best!

[caption #909]
<A2>: Could we infiltrate the Empire_?

[caption #910]
<A4>: The Empire's Magitek Research Facility_
Could the secret lie therein?

[caption #911]
<A5>: Leave Narshe to me!

[caption #912]
<A11>: <A11>_
<A11> do his best!

[caption #913]

She holds the future to our survival.

Arvis: Heard <A0> turned into light and streaked away toward the west.<EOP>
Make your way to Figaro Castle.
Maybe they can help you, there.

[caption #915]
Elder: I'm troubled_
I want to avoid fighting_
But_

[caption #916]
Moogles live deep within the mines!

[caption #917]
We follow our Elder's advice!

[caption #918]
So_magic really DOES exist!?

[caption #919]
Magic?!
Pshaw! What nonsense!

[caption #920]
Narshe is a neutral city.
We want no war here.
But that accursed Empire still_

[caption #921]
Wait, Figaro Castle can dive under the sand and travel west to Kohlingen?
Neat!

[caption #922]
The house to the far right contains the treasures I've collected! You stood up to the Empire, so they're all yours!<EOP>
Only one of them is locked. Now what do ya suppose is inside_?!

[caption #923]
A glowing form soared off toward Figaro Castle.
It seemed almost_human.

[caption #924]
Curse the day we dug up that Esper! That's what brought the Empire here!

[caption #925]
Looks like war's a'comin'!

[caption #926]
There's a sasquatch that lives inside the mine_or so I heard.

[caption #927]
Lone Wolf, the infamous thief, has been sighted here.
Are my treasures safe?

[caption #928]
Weapon and Armor shops are selling some new stuff for the coming war.

[caption #929]
Maybe we could borrow the Esper's power_ 
Would that even work_?

[caption #930]
A while ago I saw Moogles hanging out with a sasquach!
No one believes me, though_

Press the A Button, or up on the Control Pad, to go forward.
Steer with the Control Pad.<EOP>
Press the B Button to dismount. Careful! Once you get off, the bird'll return to its pen!

Chocobo ride, 100 GP!
How about it?
<C> Yes
<C> No

[caption #935]
King <A4>!
Welcome back!

[caption #936]
Gotta admit, seeing Kefka embarrassed like that brought a smile to my face.

[caption #937]
That girl blazing in light flew off past the mountains west of the desert.

[caption #938]
Who'd have thought a person could fly over a mountain range?

[caption #939]
This castle's greatest accomplishment is its ability to move freely across the desert.<EOP>
As long as there's a desert there, it can even move beyond the mountains.

[caption #940]
Wanna get past the mountains?
This castle can't fly, but it can submerge! Find the person in charge of the Engine Room!

[caption #941]
Our alliance with the Empire has been nullified.

[caption #942]
You must be tired after all that fighting!
How about a rest?

[caption #943]
<A4>: If only <A5> were here_

[caption #944]

I have to wander around for a while!

Wait. I'm going too!

_<A0>?? __Oh my_

[caption #1081]
Ramuh: Her life is not in danger. She is simply unable to control herself after using a power she's unaccustomed to.<EOP>
I am Ramuh. The Esper Ramuh.

[caption #1082]
Esper!?

[caption #1083]
[But don't Espers live in another world?]

[caption #1084]
<A6>: But don't Espers live in another world?

[caption #1085]
<A11>: Esper_ live in different world_ right?

[caption #1086]
Ramuh: That doesn't mean we can't live in this world, too. Espers come in a multitude of forms.<EOP>
My form is similar to a human's, so I am able to live here. I need not worry about being recognized as an Esper.

[caption #1087]
[Why would you hide the fact that you're an Esper?]

[caption #1088]
<A11>: Why you no say you Esper?

[caption #1089]
Ramuh: Humans and Espers are incompatible.

[caption #1090]
<A1>: But my grandma told me that Espers and people once lived side by side!<EOP>
Was that just a fairy tale?

[caption #1091]
[But my mother once told me that Espers and people once lived side by side.
Was that just a fairy tale?]

[caption #1092]
I heard that Espers and people once lived side by side.
Was that just a fairy tale_?

[caption #1093]
<A11>: <A11> hear story. People and Esper live together long time ago.

[caption #1094]
Ramuh: Ha ha, that was no fairy tale. That was true.
We started out as friends.<EOP>
That was before the War of the Magi_

[caption #1095]
War of the Magi_

[caption #1096]
Ramuh: It took place_long ago. Espers fought humans who were infused with magical power extracted from Espers_

[caption #1097]
After that meaningless struggle, the Espers, fearing their powers would be used again, crafted their own world.<EOP>
They moved there and shut the humans out. It was a world only for Espers.

[caption #1098]
That was until one day 20 years ago when humans stumbled into it. Humans who knew of Espers and Magitek.<E$18><OP$12>

[caption #1099]
Thus began a hunt for Espers. Gestahl extracted magic from those Espers and created his invincible army. <E$18><OP$12>

[caption #1100]
When they recognized this, the Espers constructed a giant gateway and expelled the humans from their world.

[caption #1101]
Ramuh: Even now, Espers who were captured back then are being held in the Empire's Magitek Research Facility_<EOP>
_being drained of their powers_
I fled here to avoid a similar fate.

[caption #1102]
Ramuh: Looks like she's calmed down a little.

[caption #1103]
Ramuh: When I sensed <A0>'s power destabilize, I called her here. She responded to my magical summon.

[caption #1104]
[<A0>'s_an Esper?]

[caption #1105]
Ramuh: No, she's a bit different from us_

[caption #1106]
[<A0> looks like she's in pain.]<EOP>
Ramuh: She harbors anxiety about the nature of her very existence.<EOP>
Her pain is a manifestation of that.

[caption #1107]
[Is there any way we can help her?]

[caption #1108]
Ramuh: When she is able to fully accept herself, her anxiety will likely be quelled.

[caption #1109]
[What should we do_?]<EOP>
Ramuh: I believe one of my brethren being held in Gestahl's Magitek Research Facility can help her.

[caption #1110]
[If we go to the Magitek Research Facility, you're sure we'll find your people?]

[caption #1111]
<A6>: Huh? The Magitek Research Facility?
Your people_ are in there?

[caption #1112]
<A11>: Magitek Research Facility_?
Your people_ there?

[caption #1113]
<A6>: The Magitek Research Facility_
That place_

[caption #1114]
Ramuh: I abandoned my brethren, escaping here and living in hiding alone.
Even still, I haven't much time.

[caption #1115]
[What do you mean?]

[caption #1116]
Ramuh: Gestahl's methods are incorrect. Draining an Esper of its power by force results in imperfect magic.<EOP>
True magic is only obtained when the Esper becomes Magicite_

[caption #1117]
[Becomes what?!]<EOP>
Ramuh: When we will ourselves to become Magicite, we can bestow you with our power.
[Magicite_?!]<EOP>
Ramuh: When an Esper dies, its power remains in this world as Magicite_
[?!]

[caption #1118]
Ramuh: These are my comrades who fell while escaping the Empire. And I will give you my power, as well_

[caption #1119]
[Why would you go this far_?]

[caption #1120]
Ramuh: If you make use of our power, you can reverse this planet's descent into death_<EOP>
You must stop them. The War of the Magi must never be repeated_

[caption #1121]

Everyone here?
I was thinking, _<EOP>
<A4>: Let's talk on the way back.

[caption #1137]
<A4>: The Empire's trying to drain magic from Espers_ <E$10><OP$12>

[caption #1138]
<A5>: This can't be true_
<A6>_? <E$10><OP$12>

[caption #1139]
<A6>: I don't remember because they put us to sleep when they gave us the Magitek infusion.<EOP>
But I've heard rumors to that effect.

[caption #1140]
<A2>: Then we shall infiltrate the Empire.<EOP>
<A4>: We'd best split into 2 groups.
We still need to beef up our defenses in Narshe.

[caption #1141]
<A2>: Indeed.

[caption #1142]
<A6>: I'll go to the Empire. You'll need someone with inside knowledge_<EOP>
<A5>: But alone_?

[caption #1143]
<A1>: Don't worry, I'll go with her.

[caption #1144]
<A6>: <A1>!

[caption #1145]
<A2>: Should thou perhaps take a few others?

[caption #1146]
<A1>: Please wait for us in Narshe. We'll find our way back safely.<EOP>
[If you wish to change group members, head for Narshe.]

[caption #1147]
<A3>: There's no need for me to remain with you.

[caption #1148]
<A6>: Having decided that, the Empire is on the continent to the south. No boats go there_<EOP>
<A1>: The people of Jidoor, a town to the south, probably have a way. They're rich, after all.

[caption #1149]
<A6>: <A1>.<EOP>
<A1>: Yeah?
<A6>: Why are you coming with me?

[caption #1150]
<A1>: Well_
There's talk of a legendary treasure there.<EOP>
I just want to have a peek around the Empire to see what I can turn up.

[caption #1151]
These days you can't just go to the Imperial continent on a whim.

[caption #1152]
If you want to get to the Southern Continent, the only way is by air.<EOP>
How to fly? Is that a serious question?
By airship, of course!

[caption #1153]
There's currently only one airship in the entire world, and it's owned by a gambler.<EOP>
Though I suppose he's more like a sky pirate.

[caption #1154]
The gambler likes flashy shows. He's always at the opera. I think he likes the beautiful divas_

[caption #1155]
You're the spittin' image of Maria! Huh? Haven't heard of her? She's a famous opera singer!

[caption #1156]
Impresario: Maria!?

[caption #1157]
<A6>: Are you talking to me?

[caption #1158]
Impresario: Sorry_my mistake.
You just bear more than a passing resemblance to our beloved diva_
Ohh_what to do_

[caption #1159]
<A6> looks just like Maria_?

[caption #1160]
That guy dropped this.

[caption #1161]
Master: He's the director of the operas here. Everyone just calls him [Impresario.]<EOP>
He's been drinking himself senseless since that letter arrived_

[caption #1162]
<A1>: Who's this [Wandering_]? what's-his-name?<EOP>
Master: You born on a farm, son?

[caption #1163]
That's <A9>, owner of the world's only airship.

[caption #1169]
Impresario: Ah! You again!

[caption #1170]
<A1>: I read that letter.
<A9>'s coming to abduct her, right?<EOP>
Impresario: He'll probably appear right at the climax of Scene 1. He loves an entrance_

[caption #1171]
<A1>: Right!
If we could only grab him then_!

[caption #1172]
Impresario: Dear me, NO!
You'll ruin the performance!
I'll lose my job!

[caption #1173]
<A6>: Then you're history!<EOP>
Impresario: This is simply horrid! I want the performance to be a success!<EOP>
But I don't want Maria to be abducted_!

[caption #1174]
<A1>: We'll let him grab her_

[caption #1175]
<A1>: We'll use a decoy. We purposely let him grab her, then follow after him.<EOP>
If we're lucky, we'll be able to commandeer his airship.

[caption #1176]
Impresario: Are you mad?!!
If something should happen to Maria_

[caption #1177]
<A1>: That's why the decoy! We'll hide Maria somewhere safe!<EOP>
Impresario: Come again?

[caption #1178]
<A1>: You said SHE looks like Maria, right?

[caption #1179]
<A6>: Now just a minute_

[caption #1180]
<A1>: We'll dress <A6> up as Maria and let her be abducted, then she'll let us onto the airship!

Hit the switch on the far right.
Don't touch any of the others.

Stage Master: Don't press the wrong switch, or you'll be in a world of pain.

Stage Master: The door in the room to the left of the stage should be open now.<EOP>
You can reach the rafters from there.

You're, you're not the real Maria, are you?!

[caption #1270]
<A6>: <A9>, we need your help. We have to go to Vector. We need this ship to get there.

[caption #1271]
<A9>: Look, if you're not Maria, I have no business with you.

[caption #1272]
<A6>: Wait! <D>
We were told your ship is the finest vessel in the world.

[caption #1273]
<A1>: And that you were the world's most notorious gambler_

[caption #1274]
<A4>: I'm the King of Figaro. If you cooperate, you'll be well rewarded_

<A5>: My brother's the King of Figaro. Cooperate, and I'll ask him to reward you.

[caption #1276]
<A2>: I am a warrior of Doma. This request comes from me as well.

[caption #1277]
<A9>: Come here.

<A6>: So_ <D><EOP>
<A9>: Don't misunderstand me. I'm still not sure if I'm going to help you.

[caption #1279]
<A9>: Hmph_
Thanks to the Empire, my business has basically dried up.

[caption #1280]
<A6>: It's not only you. There are many cities and towns under Imperial occupation.

[caption #1281]
<A1>: The Empire is abusing Magitek power to enslave the world.

[caption #1282]
<A4>: The Empire and my realm were allies_
until recently.

[caption #1283]
<A5>: There's no way we'll bow to the Empire's wishes!

[caption #1284]
<A2>: _I lost my friends_
and my family.

[caption #1285]
<A9>: The Empire <D>_huh.

[caption #1286]
<A6>: You're in the same boat as us in your disdain for the Empire. That's why_<EOP>
<A9>: You know_you're even more stunning than Maria.
<A6>: ????

[caption #1287]
<A9>: All right, I've made up my mind!<EOP>
<A6> will marry me, then I'll help you.
Those are my conditions.

[caption #1288]
<A1>: WHAT!
You can't just decide that on your own!

[caption #1289]
<A6>: Fine by me.

[caption #1290]
<A9>: Yes! It's settled!

[caption #1291]
<A6>: But I have conditions_

[caption #1292]
We'll decide with a coin toss.<EOP>
If it's heads, you'll help us. If it's tails, I'll marry you.
Well, Mr. Gambler_?

[caption #1293]
<A9>: Oho! Fine!
I accept!

[caption #1294]
<A1>: Are you all right with this, <A6>?
Becoming his wife just like that_?

[caption #1295]
<A2>: That man uses people_

[caption #1296]
<A6>: Ready?

[caption #1297]
<A6>: I win!
Now, honor your part of the bargain!

[caption #1298]
<A9>: How_unusual!
This is the first I've seen a two-headed coin.

[caption #1299]
<A6>: I think you've been hustled, Mr. Gambler.

[caption #1300]
<A9>: Ha!
How low can you get?!
I love it!<EOP>
All right, I'll help you.
Gambling my life against the Empire_<EOP>

[caption #1307]
<A9>: When things fall, they fall. <D>Life itself is just a series of wagers until you bust_

[caption #1308]
<A1>: This ship will be way too conspicuous in Imperial airspace. <EOP>
We need to land some distance away so they don't spot us.<EOP>
<A9>: Right.
I'll wait on board in case of an emergency.

[caption #1309]
<A9>: What's up?
The Empire too scary for you?

[caption #1310]
<A9>: I'll have to repair the airship. Go check what's happening in the Empire.

[caption #1311]

But the technique wasn't perfected yet, so he obtained abnormal magical powers, <EOP>

Cid: This is a disaster!
Your fighting has caused the capsules to rupture! It's too dangerous here!

Cid: Quick! Over here!

Cid: Even though Kefka has been keeping me in line with threats, I still did such terrible things_

[caption #1404]
Cid: The life-energy of those Espers_

Cid: Meeting you has helped me come to a decision. I'm going to talk to the Emperor and have this stupid war stopped!

Cid: <A6>_
I've known her since she was a baby. I raised her as if she was my own daughter!<EOP>
But the whole time she was also being groomed as a Magitek Knight, and has done some awful things.<EOP>
If I ever see her again, I want to apologize_
for everything I've done_

Cid: No! It's Kefka!

Maduin: Hello...?
Hang in there...<EOP>
What should I do?
<C> (Take her back with you?)
<C> (Leave her here?)

[caption #1425]
She's pretty weak.
Better let her rest for a moment.

[caption #1426]
Elder: You say there's a human?<EOP>
Maduin: She likely_
made some error in judgement and wandered in from the other side.

[caption #1427]
Elder: This evening is an ill omen_

[caption #1428]
You okay, Maduin?

[caption #1429]
You'd better kill her right away. Humans and Espers are incompatible_

[caption #1430]
You're the Gate Keeper, Maduin?

[caption #1431]
Everyone here's feeling uneasy.

[caption #1432]
You've wanted to take a peek into the human world beyond the gate up north, huh, Maduin?

[caption #1433]
Why'd you bring that thing here?

[caption #1434]
Strong winds_
Be careful, Maduin.

[caption #1435]
The barrier between our worlds has surely weakened over the past 1000 years.

[caption #1436]
You okay Maduin?

[caption #1437]
Do you even know what you've done?

[caption #1438]
Elder's orders_
No one passes through the gate.

Emergency!
Something's coming through the gate!

Maduin: Did I awaken you?

[caption #1444]
Girl: You're_an Esper?
What's this pendant on my neck?

[caption #1445]
Maduin: It's my gift to you.
It's an Esper World charm.<EOP>
Girl: Esper World_
I really DID get lost.<EOP>
Maduin: The Esper folk are pretty uneasy, you being a human and all_<EOP>
Girl: You the one who_saved me?

[caption #1446]
Madeline: My name is Madeline.
The human world has degraded.<EOP>
I hated how it had become swirling with hatred and greed, so I wandered into a storm and somehow ended up_

[caption #1447]
Maduin: Are humans and Espers
truly_so different?

[caption #1448]
Madeline: So I guess I'm considered [evil] in this world, too_
Maduin: No, I mean_

[caption #1449]
Madeline: I'll return to the human world tomorrow.
Maduin: You'll need a guide.

[caption #1450]
Elder: Are you all right with this?
That human already left.

[caption #1451]
If the humans knew of the Espers' power_
And they sought to use it_<EOP>
That would doom us all.

[caption #1452]
If you're looking for the human girl, she went to the gate between the human and Esper world a while ago.

[caption #1453]
But no human has ever wandered in here in centuries, so why now?

[caption #1454]
Youth: What's wrong, Maduin?

[caption #1455]
Maduin: If you don't want to return to your world, you may stay here.<EOP>
Madeline: But humans and Espers can never coexist_!

[caption #1456]
Maduin: How do we know for sure unless we observe for ourselves?

[caption #1457]

    How do we know_

[caption #1458]

        unless we_

[caption #1459]

   observe for ourselves_?

[caption #1460]
Maduin: We've given her a name_
Madeline: What?<EOP>
Maduin: It's <A0>.
It's a good name, right?

[caption #1461]

      2 years later_

[caption #1462]
Humans!!!!!
The barrier has weakened again. Just like that day of the storm 2 years ago_

[caption #1463]
But it's different from when Madeline came.
It's an army seeking our magic powers.

[caption #1464]
Blast it!
Retreat to the Elder's house!

[caption #1465]
Gestahl: Aha!
We've finally found it!<EOP>
Our search for the secret entrance to the Esper World spoken of in ancient texts has finally paid off!

[caption #1466]
Gestahl: Grab them!
Riches to any man who captures an Esper!
GO!

[caption #1467]
Elder: We've no choice_
I'd hoped we wouldn't have to resort to this, but_<EOP>
Maduin: You mean_
seal the gate?

[caption #1468]
It's dangerous out there!

[caption #1469]
Soon the humans will arrive!

[caption #1470]
Madeline: <A0>'s all right.

[caption #1471]
Elder: Here's the plan. We'll cause a tempest that'll sweep all the nasty creatures out of our realm.<EOP>
Then we place a seal on the gate. This spell can only be performed by Espers of a particular bloodline.<EOP>
I am the only one left who can do it.

[caption #1472]
Maduin: But in your state, you might just_<EOP>
Elder: I will likely die.
But with my death, the sealed gate shall never open again.<EOP>
Maduin: Are you all right with that, Madeline?

[caption #1473]
Madeline: I no longer bear any attachment to the other side.

[caption #1474]
Elder: Let's do it.
We have no other choice.

[caption #1475]
Esper: This is all because of that human girl!<EOP>
Maduin: Nonsense!<EOP>
Esper: I'm sure she led them to us.

[caption #1476]
Maduin: Get a grip on yourself!<EOP>
Esper: No! She's one of them!
Soon she'll be wearing our hide!

[caption #1477]
Maduin: Oh no!

[caption #1478]
Madeline took <A0> to the gate!

[caption #1479]
Elder: It's dangerous! Where are you going? _ Urghh_
Maduin: It's Madeline!<EOP>
Elder: Impossible!
It's too late! I've already begun casting the barrier. You won't be able to come back!<EOP>
Maduin: I don't care!

That's where I got my powers_<EOP>
I'm all right now. I should be able to control my power, at least for short periods of time_

[caption #1492]
<A4>: So Gestahl must've known the secret of the Espers' power back then.<EOP>
<A1>: And those Espers at the facility were grabbed during that expedition!<EOP>
That means <A6>'s power came__
at the expense of an Esper_

The Imperial troopers are gone! Let's dance! Let's sing!

[caption #1554]
I was forced into the Empire's army. They made me do some awful things_

[caption #1555]
It's a bit lonely now_

[caption #1556]
Most of the town's youths were led off to serve as Imperial troopers.

[caption #1557]
Our poor kids that got shipped off to war will be back soon, won't they?

There's huge gate deep inside a cave to the east. I heard about it from my grandfather.

Time to put Tzen back together!

[caption #1560]
Our royal family was slaughtered by the Empire.

[caption #1561]
Thanks to you people peace has been achieved!

Some friendly advice! There's a weapon called the Guardian.
It can't move, but it's very powerful. Run, if you meet it!

This is the port city of Albrook. We've been occupied by the Empire_

[caption #1579]
Business is picking up in the port! Maybe economy will make a recovery!

[caption #1580]
How could an island float in the sky?!

[caption #1581]
They say there's something important to the east_
The Empire built a base there, and no one may enter.

[caption #1582]
I heard some monsters flew out of the mountain beyond the base and attacked the Empire!

[caption #1583]
Yeah, thanks to that flying island, this town was shrouded in darkness!

[caption #1584]
We have to bribe the troopers to do business here_
*sob*

[caption #1585]
We've got nothing to sell to Imperials! <D>
_Ahh, I've wanted to say that for a long time.

[caption #1586]
The shoe's on the other foot now_
*sob*

People are disappearing from the Empire_?
And now there's that floating island_
I've got a ba~ad feeling about this_

[caption #1588]
Vector, capital of the Empire, is at the center of this continent.

[caption #1589]
You'll find some good weapons and items in Tzen and Maranda.

[caption #1590]
Some strange guy's tryin' to sell glowing stones_
When I wouldn't take one, he said he was going to Tzen.

[caption #1591]
I'm a scholar of magic. Monsters on this continent are weak to magic.

[caption #1592]
I found this in a 1000 year-old text:<EOP>
[8 dragons seal this awesome beast.
Defeat these dragons, and its power released_]

[caption #1593]
I'm a scholar of weapons. 1000 years ago, during the War of the Magi, 2 so-called Ultima Weapons existed.<EOP>
One changed a person's power into a sword, the other was an monster, bred for mass destruction.

[caption #1594]
No entry into the port!

[caption #1595]
Ah_welcome!

[caption #1596]
Hey_you're not of the Empire!
Get outta here!

In any case, you're probably broke!

Ahaaa!!
Whooopie!

[caption #1599]
Look out if you're caught working with the Returners.

[caption #1600]
Now maybe we can get on with our lives.

[caption #1601]
I heard that Espers attacked the Empire_

[caption #1602]
All's well!

[caption #1603]
Is the war really over_?

[caption #1604]
Damn it_
These Imperial soldiers just do whatever they please.

[caption #1605]
This cafe is like an Imperial soldiers' dormitory!

Since the soldiers are leaving, business is bound to pick up. Oops_better keep my mouth shut.

Sure! No problem!

How 'bout it?

Banon: Oh, you're here!
The people of Narshe have finally decided to battle the Empire.<EOP>
How did it go at Vector_?

[caption #1613]
Arvis: I see_ <EOP>
We've worked out a plan to combine Narshe's resources with Figaro's technology to storm the Empire, but_<EOP>
we likely don't have sufficient manpower_

[caption #1614]
Banon: Perhaps all we can do is open the Sealed Gate_

[caption #1615]
<A0>: To the Esper World_?

[caption #1616]
Arvis: There's no way to defeat the Empire without their help.

[caption #1617]
Banon: If we open the Sealed Gate, which lies to the east of the Empire, the Espers can attack from there.<EOP>
Meanwhile, we can attack from the north.

[caption #1618]
Banon: But that's only if we can persuade the Espers to join our cause_<EOP>
We must re-forge the bond between Espers and humans.
And the only one who can is_

[caption #1619]
Humans and Espers_
If such a bond was impossible
then I wouldn't even exist__

[caption #1620]
<A0>_

[caption #1621]
<A0>: I'll do it.
I'm the only one who can!

[caption #1622]
<A0>!?

[caption #1623]
So it's to be an attack on two fronts.

[caption #1624]
Narshe's Elder: So the time to fight the Empire has finally come_
I suppose it was inevitable_

[caption #1625]
Banon: Get the Espers to understand, and we can bring this war to a screeching halt.<EOP>
<A0>_
I know you can do this_

[caption #1626]
Arvis: The Sealed Gate stands at the eastern edge of the Empire.<EOP>
There's a base there, but somehow we'll have to slip through_

[caption #1627]
<A1>: The Sealed Gate_
Can you sense anything, <A0>?

[caption #1628]
<A0>: __

[caption #1629]
<A1>: <A0>_

[caption #1630]
There's no negotiating with the Espers without <A0>_

but I'm afraid to do it alone__

[caption #1632]
That's odd_<EOP>
No Imperial soldiers_

<A1>: I'm sure the Espers were headed for Vector_

[caption #1658]
<A2>: I shall never forgive the Empire for its crimes.

[caption #1659]
<A2>: I could feel the warrior spirits of those Espers!

[caption #1660]
<A3>: __
Why am I here_? <D>
For the money, I guess.

[caption #1661]
<A3>: I think Kefka's out for General Leo's hide!

[caption #1662]
<A4>: I'm not here goofing off, I'm planning our next strategy.

[caption #1663]
<A4>: Somehow we need to tap in to the power of those Espers_

[caption #1664]
<A5>: Let me at the Empire!

[caption #1665]
<A5>: Let's see what's become of the Empire! Hurry!

[caption #1666]
<A6>: I was one of the Empire's generals, but I still know evil when I see it.

[caption #1667]
<A6>: Kefka's sure to come up with another demented plan. We need to do something FAST!

[caption #1668]
<A7>: I was once a world-hopping adventurer, too, you know_

[caption #1669]
<A7>: I've lived a long time, but that's the first time I've fallen from so high.

[caption #1670]
<A8>: I know.
Let me draw their portraits!

[caption #1671]
<A8>: I'm sure those Espers are all very kind!

[caption #1672]
<A9>: The most precious things_?<EOP>
People who hold things too dearly aren't willing to wager them!

[caption #1673]
<A9>: Urghh!
For the time being, I don't own the skies_

[caption #1674]
<A10>: Allow me to shoulder some of your burden.

[caption #1675]
Mog: _puuh_

[caption #1676]
<A11>: <A11> become stronger on the Veldt.

[caption #1679]
<A13>: Uhhhh_

[caption #1680]
<A0>: _the Espers_
were angry_

[caption #1681]
What happened?

[caption #1682]
The Espers flew off together_

[caption #1683]
Then, the Empire's citizens ran off, as though they were terrified.

[caption #1684]
Which way did the Espers go?

[caption #1685]
Toward the capital_

[caption #1686]

There's something under the ground_

[caption #1687]
Vector_

[caption #1688]
<A9>: We're almost at Vector.

[caption #1689]
There! What's that?

[caption #1690]
There's a switch inside.
What will you do?
<C> (Flick the switch.)
<C> (Leave it alone.)

[caption #1691]

    Heard a distant sound_

[caption #1692]
N_nuts!!! I thought I had the monopoly on the stuff buried around the bottom of that big stairwell_<EOP>
Digging around that open area would've landed me a treasure trove!

[caption #1693]

        Got [Inviz Edge.]

[caption #1694]

        Got [Super Ball.]

[caption #1695]

      Something's buried_

        Got [Shadow Edge.]

[caption #1701]
The Emperor's expecting you.
This way_

[caption #1702]
Emperor Gestahl awaits inside.

[caption #1703]
The Espers that emerged from the Sealed Gate came and laid waste to the Empire_<EOP>
The country's in ruins_

[caption #1704]
We've lost our will to fight.

[caption #1705]
When the Emperor learned of the atrocities that Kefka had committed, he threw him in prison.<EOP>
Looks like he'll be rotting there for the rest of his life.

[caption #1706]
The war's over_

[caption #1707]
The power of the Espers_
It's terrifying_

[caption #1708]
The Espers surely came to free their friends_

[caption #1709]
Peace at last_

[caption #1710]
The Magitek Research Facility's been dismantled.

[caption #1711]
You!?
How'd you get in here?

[caption #1712]
It sounds like the Emperor is open to talking peace with the Returners and other nations.

[caption #1713]
Kefka's been locked in the basement prison.<EOP>
Seems the Emperor found out that he used poison in order to capture Doma.

[caption #1714]
Kefka! Using poison_
how low can you get?!
I've always hated you!

[caption #1715]
Kefka: Hmph!
How DARE they put me in a place like this!
Graah!

[caption #1716]
Kefka: Inconceivable!!!

[caption #1717]
Kefka: What a bore.

[caption #1718]
Kefka's scum_
It serves him right!

[caption #1719]
The war was long and brutal_
I lost my entire family_

[caption #1720]
The war ended before we could use this machine_

[caption #1721]
Kefka's in jail!

[caption #1722]
Gestahl: I've lost my will to fight_

[caption #1723]
Cid: The Emperor's had a change of heart_

[caption #1724]
Cid!!

[caption #1725]
Cid: The Espers came to save their friends. When they learned the others had perished, they went berserk,<EOP>
and trashed the town_
Never will I forget their shrieks of rage_

[caption #1726]
Sentry: We have no more desire to fight. The war is over.

[caption #1727]
Gestahl: The power of those Espers_
Perhaps I had been naiive_<EOP>
If the Espers continue to run rampant they'll destroy the world. The Empire's power is infantile compared to them.<EOP>
We must find some way to negotiate with them and quell their anger.

[caption #1728]
Cid: This is something beyond the capability of a human_

[caption #1729]
Gestahl: Worthy warriors.
For tonight, let us dine together and open discussions.

[caption #1730]
Cid: There are some soldiers who still aren't too keen on peace.<EOP>
Please, before we dine, talk to as many soldiers as you can! Make them understand!

[caption #1731]
Dinner preparations underway.
One moment, please.

[caption #1732]
Trooper: Please talk to as many soldiers as you can. You have 4 minutes until dinner.

[caption #1733]
Only the chest in the back is locked. Can it be opened_?

Emperor Gestahl commissioned a painting from me, but_
what should I paint_?

[caption #1750]
I finished the painting the Emperor requested_
It was a portrait of Gestahl himself.<EOP>
I put everything he wanted into it_ but it just wasn't meant to be_<EOP>
I sold it to Owzer, the rich man who lives in Jidoor.

That evening, the banquet
with the Emperor took place_

[caption #1767]
Trooper: This way, please.

[caption #1768]
Cid: I'll be sitting on the Returners' side this time.

[caption #1769]
Gestahl: Imagine!
All of us here together at the same table! First we must have a toast!

[caption #1770]
<C> To the Empire_
<C> To the Returners_
<C> To our hometowns_

[caption #1771]
Gestahl: Well then_
To our hometowns!

[caption #1772]
Gestahl: Well then_
To the Empire!

[caption #1773]
Gestahl: Well then_
To the Returners!

[caption #1774]
Gestahl: As you know, Kefka's in jail for the poisoning of Doma.
What shall we do with him?

[caption #1775]
<C> Leave him in jail_
<C> Pardon him_
<C> Execute him_

[caption #1776]
<A4>: Albrook's a port to the south of the Empire.<EOP>
The plan is to board a Magitek Armor freighter ship there and make for Crescent Island_<EOP>
We'll stay here and keep an eye on the Imperials.
You take care of the Espers.

[caption #1777]
<A5>: Can we really trust the Empire?! I have an awful feeling about this_

[caption #1778]
<A2>: Never will I be able to forgive Kefka_

[caption #1779]
<A11>: Smelly drinks here_
Smell like_ father_?

[caption #1780]
Mog: Kupo!

[caption #1781]
Emperor: General Leo awaits in Albrook. Please accompany him to Crescent Island and look for the Espers_

[caption #1782]
Gestahl: Hmm_
Well, let's let him stew in his cell for a while. Then we'll decide what to do.

[caption #1783]
<C> Why'd you start the war?
<C> Why do you want peace now?
<C> Why'd we have to talk to 
      your men?

[caption #1784]
Gestahl: Everything that's happened was because of my lust for power.
I regret it all now_

[caption #1785]
Gestahl: I feel we need each other's help at this time_

[caption #1786]
Gestahl: Some of my men refuse to embrace peace. I felt they'd understand if they actually met you face to face.

[caption #1787]
Gestahl: With your permission, I'd like to talk about the Espers_

[caption #1788]
<C> One more question please!
<C> Okay.

[caption #1789]
<C> One more question please!
<C> Let's talk about Espers_

[caption #1790]
Gestahl: I assure you, I have answered your questions truthfully.

[caption #1791]
Gestahl: My Empire's been decimated by the Espers that emerged from the Sealed Gate.<EOP>
Their power is just too great. Unless we stop them, they might destroy the world_

[caption #1792]
<C> Yes, the Espers have gone
     too far.
<C> But you unleashed their
     power!!

[caption #1793]
Gestahl: When I saw the destruction the Espers had wrought on the Empire, my lust for power vanished.<EOP>
I asked myself why I had wanted that power in the first place.
And I had no answer_<EOP>
Even so, it doesn't undo all of the things I have already done_<EOP>
By the way_<EOP>
About those questions you asked me_
which did you ask first?

[caption #1794]
Gestahl: Right. Anyway, more than anything I want peace. That's my true dream. I want you to understand that!

[caption #1795]
Cid: You seem a bit tired.
Care for a rest break?

[caption #1796]
<C> Yes, let's take a break.
<C> Let's keep talking.

[caption #1797]
Shall we resume discussions?
<C> Yes
<C> No

[caption #1798]
Gestahl: Is there anything you wish to hear me say?

[caption #1799]
<C> That all you really want
     is peace.
<C> That your war's truly over.
<C> That you're sorry_

[caption #1800]
Gestahl: __

[caption #1801]
Cid: It would be wonderful if this led to peace_

[caption #1802]
Trooper: We want to test your strength!<EOP>
Won't you fight with us for a couple of minutes?
<C> Sure
<C> Sorry

[caption #1803]
Trooper: I see_

[caption #1804]
Gestahl: I understand.
My only dream in life is_peace! Now I must ask for a favor_

[caption #1805]
Gestahl: I understand.
I pledge that this war is over for good! Now I must ask for a favor_

[caption #1806]
Gestahl: I understand.
I'm truly sorry for what I've done! Now I must ask for a favor_

[caption #1807]
Gestahl: After they devastated my Empire, the Espers headed northward, toward Crescent Island.<EOP>
There is no telling when they'll go on the rampage again.
I would like to find them and begin mediation_<EOP>
But after everything the Empire has done to the Espers, I fear they would refuse to speak to us_<EOP>
That is why_ <D>
We need <A0>'s help.

[caption #1808]
Only <A0> can bridge the gap between Esper and human.

[caption #1809]
Gestahl: We must make for Crescent Island aboard the freighter from Albrook.<EOP>
Will you go along?
<C> Yes
<C> No

[caption #1810]
Gestahl: We cannot simply ignore the Espers!!<EOP>
Please_go along!
<C> Yes
<C> No

[caption #1811]
Gestahl: I'll have my finest general and his men accompany you!
General Leo!

[caption #1812]
Leo: I am General Leo
A pleasure to meet you.

[caption #1813]
<A5>: Didn't I see him at Doma?
Yeah, he was the principled one.
So he's General Leo_

[caption #1814]
Leo: Is it you?! Sir <A2> of Doma? Please forgive me for not being there to stop Kefka from using poison_<EOP>
<A2>: __
That wasn't your fault.

[caption #1815]
Leo: I shall await you in Albrook.

[caption #1816]
Gestahl: We must find the Espers and come to terms with them! You are our last hope!

[caption #1817]
<A1>: If <A0> goes, I'll go.

[caption #1818]
<A0>: <A1>_
Thank you_

[caption #1819]
<A1>: The rest of you wait here. I smell a rat_

[caption #1820]
<A4>: Agreed_
It's hard to trust the Emperor just like that_

[caption #1821]
<A2>: We'll stay here and investigate.

[caption #1822]
<A1>: Please do.
Leave no stone unturned!

[caption #1823]
<A4>: Right.
And you be careful, too!

[caption #1824]
Gestahl: I truly apologize about the poisoning of Doma.
No one dreamed Kefka would use poison.

[caption #1825]
<C> What's done is done_
<C> That was inexcusable.
<C> Apologize again!!

[caption #1826]
Gestahl: I'm so terribly sorry! Kefka's being severely punished, and we're cleaning up the poison.

[caption #1827]
Gestahl: By the way_
With regard to General <A6>_

[caption #1828]
<C> Was she an Imperial spy?
<C> <A6> is one of us!
<C> We trust <A6>!

[caption #1829]
Gestahl: Kefka was lying.
General <A6> realized the war was folly before anyone else.<EOP>
That's why she joined the Returners. Any other questions for me?

Imperial troops have withdrawn from South Figaro.

<D>is it possible for me to love a human, too?

[caption #1912]
Leo: Of course!

[caption #1913]
<A0>: But_
<D>I still don't know what it feels like to love_ <D>or be loved_

[caption #1914]
Leo: You're just young.
With time and experience, you'll figure it out.
I'm sure of it.

[caption #1915]
<A0>: But_
<D>I want to know now_

[caption #1916]
<A0>: Who is it?

[caption #1917]
<A3>: Thought I'd sleep out under the stars.

[caption #1918]
<A0>: Did you hear_
<D>_what we were just talking about?

[caption #1919]
<A0>: So_

[caption #1920]
<A3>: I can't help you.
This is an answer you need to find yourself.

[caption #1921]
<A3>: I didn't mean to overhear anything.

[caption #1922]
<A3>: <A0>.

[caption #1923]
<A3>: In this world are many like me who've killed their emotions. Don't forget that.

[caption #1924]
Leo: We're almost at Crescent Island. When we disembark, we'll split into two groups.<EOP>
<A6> and I will form one group. <A0>, you go with <A1> and <A3>.<EOP>
If you spot the Espers, report at once!

[caption #1925]
Leo: <A0>, we can continue last night's conversation when we see each other again_

[caption #1926]
<A1>: Shall we get going?

[caption #1927]
<A6>: Um, I_

[caption #1928]
<A1>: Let's go.

[caption #1929]
Oh, wow!!!
Strangers!!

[caption #1930]
Mayor: Welcome, welcome!
<D>Magic_? What is this [magic]?

[caption #1931]
Mayor: Please tell no one of our ability to use magic.

[caption #1932]
Use rods as items during battle for some amazing results!<EOP>
Only problem is they break after being used once!

[caption #1933]
Have you talked to old man <A7>? Do so, and the inn keeper may be more reasonable.

[caption #1934]
The innkeeper hates strangers. He charges them an arm and a leg.

[caption #1935]
You're strangers_<EOP>
1500 GP if you wanna stay.
<C> (Well, okay.)
<C> (No way!)

[caption #1936]
Espers? What in blazes are they? If they're animals, talk to the old guy that lives on the edge of town.

[caption #1937]
Ha!
No admittance!

[caption #1938]
Old man <A7> doesn't look it, but a long time ago he was an amazing monster hunter.

[caption #1939]
Have you met little <A8>? She loves to paint pictures! Wonder if she'd do my portrait?

[caption #1940]
Actually, <A8> isn't <A7>'s real grandchild.<EOP>
I heard she's his friend's daughter.

[caption #1941]
<A7> is a Blue Mage by training. He can memorize the attacks of monsters he fights.<EOP>
But only if he's not unconscious or confused.

[caption #1942]
Listen, I have to tell you_ <D>
Naaah_never mind.

[caption #1943]
My house burned down!

[caption #1944]
Get outta the way!

[caption #1945]
I've never seen you before.

[caption #1946]
__ <D>Hmph!

[caption #1947]
Who might you be?

[caption #1948]
1 GP per night.
Why not relax for a spell?
<C> Yes
<C> No

[caption #1949]
You need somethin' from me?

[caption #1950]
An elderly gentleman, pure of heart, and learned in the ways of monsters_

[caption #1951]
FIRE!!

[caption #1952]
Uh?! What was that?

[caption #1953]
N'ga! Oh no!

[caption #1954]
Mama_it hurts_

[caption #1955]
Oh all right. Cure_

[caption #1956]
_medicine_where is my cure medicine?!

[caption #1957]
Mama!
Please use Cure on me!

[caption #1958]
<A7>: Espers?
Espers_Hmm_
Been a while since I've heard that word.<EOP>
<A1>: But you've heard it before?

[caption #1959]
<A7>: Nope, uhn uhn_
Can't say I have.
<D>Honestly <D>can't say <D>I have! <D>

[caption #1960]
Grandpa!

[caption #1961]
<A7>: Hey_HEY!

[caption #1962]
<A7>: What in blazes_
What're you doing?

[caption #1963]
In her pictures she captures everything:
forests, water, light_
the very essence of life_

[caption #1964]
That's odd_

[caption #1965]
<A8>: Grandpa.
Who are these people? Friends? Can they use magic, too?
<A7>: Yaa! Hush!

[caption #1966]
<A8>: What a cute doggy!
<A3>: Get away.
He bites.

[caption #1967]
<A7>: Go to your room!
<A8>: But whyyy~?!
What a fussy old man!

[caption #1968]
<A7>: Please_leave us!
<A8>: Fiiine.

[caption #1969]
<A8>: What a sweet puppy!

[caption #1970]
<A7>: Hoo boy_
Seems to like your dog_

[caption #1971]
<A7>: This is terrible_

[caption #1972]
<A7>: Sorry.
<A3>: No problem.
The dog usually doesn't like people, though_

[caption #1973]
<A7>: I'm sorry, though.
I don't think I can help you.
<A1>: Oh_?<EOP>
<A7>: This is just a back-water village. We have a~absolutely nothing to do with Espers_

[caption #1974]
<A1>: Hmm_
<D>There's something up with this village_<EOP>
<A0>: Let's have a look around.

[caption #1975]
<A1>: Thanks for your time!
<A7>: Sorry I couldn't have been more helpful!

[caption #1976]
<A3>: Interceptor!
Come!

[caption #1977]
<A8>: Bye-bye!

[caption #1978]
<A7>: What a beautiful day.

[caption #1979]
<A8>: Interceptor, please come back again and play!

[caption #1980]
<A7>: Emergency!
It's <A8>! She's_!

[caption #1981]
<A0>: <A8>'s in danger?
<A7>: Yes!<EOP>
She was at a neighbor's house when a fire broke out. I won't be able to stand it if something happens to her!

[caption #1982]
<A7>: Please!
Won't you help?!

[caption #1983]
<A1>: <A3>!

[caption #1984]
<A3>: Interceptor_
<D>Where are you?!

[caption #1985]
Waaah_my beautiful house_!

[caption #1986]
<A7>: <A8>'s inside that house!

[caption #1987]
FIRE!!

[caption #1988]
<A7>: <A8>!!!!!

[caption #1989]
<A1>: What're you doing?

[caption #1990]
Flames be GONE!!! <E$02><OP$12>

[caption #1991]
Mayor: Magic is forbidden!
<A0>: Magic_?!

[caption #1992]
<A7>: I don't care!
<D><A8>'s inside!!!

[caption #1993]
Mayor!!

[caption #1994]
Mayor: All right.
<D>We really have no choice.

[caption #1995]
Mayor: Stand back.

[caption #1996]
<A7>: It's no use.
The fire's too strong!<EOP>
Mayor: I think that's because they keep so many Fire Rods in here_

[caption #1997]
<A7>: I'm going in!

[caption #1998]
<A0>: Wait_I'm going too.
<A1>: Count me in. You'd better stay out here, gramps.<EOP>
<A7>: Fool!
I may be old, but I'm not powerless!

[caption #1999]
Quickly!

[caption #2000]
Is this the source of our blaze_?

[caption #2001]
<A1>: The fire's spreading fast.
<A0>: It could collapse any minute!<EOP>
<A7>: Hurry!
We have to find <A8>!

[caption #2002]
Uwaaa!!
Too late! <E$05><OP$12>

[caption #2003]
Huh!? <E$02><OP$12>

[caption #2004]
<A7>: <A8>!!!
Where are you?!

[caption #2005]
<A3>: Time to make our escape! <D>I'll use a Smoke Bomb!!

[caption #2006]
<A7>: Are you okay?
<A8>: Yes. Thanks, Grandpa!

[caption #2007]
<A7>: Save your thanks for these people.
<A8>: Thank you_

[caption #2008]
<A7>: I guess our town's little secret is out now_

[caption #2009]
<A1>: Can everyone here use magic? What's going on here?

[caption #2010]
<A7>: This is_
<D>_the village of Mages_

[caption #2011]
<A7>: Long ago humans used Magicite to gain magical powers. They came to be known as Mages.

[caption #2012]
<A1>: I thought Mages didn't exist anymore_

[caption #2013]
<A7>: After the War of the Magi, the Espers fled to their new world behind the sealed gate.<EOP>
They feared their powers being exploited again. However, the humans were left behind_<EOP>
But regular humans feared magical power most of all. The horrors of the War of the Magi were seared into their minds.

[caption #2014]
<A7>: Thus began the culling of Mages.
Given sham trials and executed one after the other_<EOP>
<A0>: Even though nothing differentiated them from other humans besides their magic_?

[caption #2015]
<A7>: A few Mages escaped and found their way here. They were our ancestors.<EOP>
Our powers have weakened over time, but some of it remains.

[caption #2016]
<A0>: Look, if you're up to it, we could use your help. <D><EOP>
<A7>: So, you're after the Espers, eh_?

[caption #2017]
<A7>: Well, I owe you for saving <A8>. <D>I'll help you find your Espers.

[caption #2018]
<A8>: Me too! <D>
<A7>: I don't think so.

[caption #2019]
<A8>: What a fuddy duddy_

[caption #2020]
<A1>: But_where do we start looking?<EOP>
<A7>: Hmm_
<D>If they're here, they must be  hiding in the mountains to the west.

[caption #2021]
<A1>: Why there?
<A7>: Those mountains have powerful magical properties.<EOP>
Legend has it that it's a sacred place to the Espers.

[caption #2022]
<A0>: So the rampaging Espers were drawn by that magical power_?

[caption #2023]
<A1>: I think it's worth a look.

[caption #2024]
<A3>: Don't misunderstand me. I just wanted my dog back.

[caption #2025]
<A1>: Going somewhere?
<A3>: I'll search for the Espers in my own way.

[caption #2026]
Ultros: G'heh, heh_these shiny statues are all mine!<EOP>
Pulling off a heist like this will finally get folks to take me seriously!

[caption #2027]
Ultros: Oh!
They're glowing!!
They're_beautiful!

[caption #2028]
<A1>: Hey, squidball!
You wanna get beaten a third time?<EOP>
Ultros: Well, they do say third time's the charm!

[caption #2029]
<A8>: Hey! Did you see me? I was awesome!
Wouldn't I be more helpful than Gramps?<EOP>
<A7>: G_GRAMPS!!?

[caption #2030]
<A0>: I suppose it wouldn't hurt to have you along_

[caption #2031]
<A7>: I can't believe it_
<D>Idols of the Warring Triad?!
<A0>: Warring Triad?

[caption #2032]
The birth of magic_<EOP>
Three gods descended from the heavens and began warring amongst themselves.<EOP>
Those caught up in the battle were transformed into Espers and fought unendingly as slaves of the gods

[caption #2033]
<A1>: Some faint letters are carved on the back of the stone figures_

[caption #2034]
<A1>: Say, old man, what else can you tell us about the Warring Triad?

[caption #2035]
<A7>: They are the gods of legend who brought magic to this world long ago.<EOP>
<A1>: So, they're the gods of magic, then?
<A7>: You could say that.

[caption #2036]
<A0>: I can feel their power_
<A7>: The Warring Triad created magic.<EOP>
They are also said to be the ones who created Espers.<EOP>
Legend has it the Espers created idols of the Warring Triad and enshrined them.
This must be that place.

[caption #2037]
<A0>: So the Espers must have been drawn to this island by those idols' magical powers.

[caption #2038]
Realizing that their great power was wreaking havoc on the world, the gods neutralized their powers <EOP>
and sealed themselves away.<EOP>
With the last of their strength, they granted the Espers free will and then turned themselves to stone.<EOP>
The gods' last words to the Espers were [Leave us sealed for all eternity].

[caption #2039]
These idols were created as a invocation to never utilize the sleeping gods' powers again.<EOP>
A warning to future generations that the gods have meddled in earthly affairs.

[caption #2040]
<A1>: I kiiinda get it?<EOP>
<A0>: If the Espers were attracted here by these idols, they must be around here somewhere!

[caption #2041]
<A1>: Say, old timer,
what happened to the Warring Triad after they created the Espers?<EOP>
<A7>: Legend has it they were exhausted from battle and turned themselves to stone in an eternal slumber.<EOP>
They're somewhere beyond the Sealed Gate.

[caption #2042]
<A0>: The Sealed Gate acts as a magical divide between the Esper world and this one.<EOP>
I wonder if that's due to the Warring Triad's power, too?

[caption #2043]
<A8>: Are these_Espers?!

[caption #2044]
<A0>: I didn't realize there were so many_ <D><EOP>
<A1>: Gramps, take <A8> and clear outta here!

[caption #2045]
<A7>: What are they doing?!

[caption #2046]
Yura: Halt!

[caption #2047]
<A8>: What is it?
<A7>: I sense some immense magical power in <A0>_ <D>Esper magic_

[caption #2048]
<A1>: Is she gonna lose her mind again like before?

[caption #2049]
Yura: You're somehow different_
<D>I sense a power like ours radiating from you_<EOP>
<A0>: Yes.

[caption #2050]
<A7>: You're young Espers from the Esper world?<EOP>
Yura: As a rule, we are not allowed to visit to your world.<EOP>
But we gathered in front of the gateway in order to save our brethren who had been turned into Magicite.<EOP>
That's when <A0> appeared_

[caption #2051]
<A0>: I felt_
your presence_
through the gate.<EOP>
Yura: We bolted the moment <A0> opened the gate.
But once in your world, we lost control of our powers.

[caption #2052]
Yura: We completely leveled a city_and took some innocent lives_

[caption #2053]
<A0>: That's what happened to me! My power suddenly surfaced and I couldn't control it_

[caption #2054]
<A7>: There must be something in the Esper world that mitigates their power.<EOP>
And because they were abruptly released from that mitigation_

[caption #2055]
Yura: We are deeply sorry to have caused you humans such suffering and pain while in our mindless state.

[caption #2056]
<A1>: The Empire is seeking to make amends with you. What do you think? Will you come with us?<EOP>
Yura: They would forgive us so easily?

[caption #2057]
<A1>: Let's go to Thamasa and talk with General Leo.
<A0>: Right!

[caption #2058]
<A0>: General Leo.<EOP>
Leo: <A0>_ you're back! And I see you've made contact with the Espers!
I knew you could do it!

[caption #2059]
Leo: I am Leo, a general of the Empire.
May I have your name, please?
Yura: I am called Yura.

[caption #2060]
Yura: We have done something inexcusable to your people.<EOP>
Yura: This probably isn't the time or place to ask for your forgiveness, but_

[caption #2061]
Leo: Speak no further. It is not my intention to criticize you for your actions.<EOP>
On the contrary, it is appalling that we only thought of you as weapons of war rather than as fellow people.<EOP>
We were on the cusp of repeating the mistakes of the War of the Magi_<EOP>
Yura: I am gladdened to hear you say that.

[caption #2062]
Kefka: This town is pitifully boring. Some fire might brighten things up!

[caption #2063]
<A1>: Looks like our work here is done. True peace is finally within our grasp.<EOP>
<A6>: Let's return to Vector.

[caption #2064]
<A6>: Please, not another word.

[caption #2065]
<A8>: Ooh, it's getting steamy!
<A7>: Ah, youth.

[caption #2066]
Leo: Kefka! What is the meaning of this?!
Kefka: G'ha, ha, ha! Emperor's orders!<EOP>
I've been tasked with returning with the Magicite remains of those Espers.<EOP>
Normally an Esper can only become Magicite willingly, but modify some Slave Crown Magitek, and behold!!

[caption #2067]
Leo: Kefka! Stop this!

[caption #2068]
Kefka: Shut up!

[caption #2069]
M.Tek Trooper: General Leo, prepare yourself!

[caption #2070]
Leo: No use! I need to fall back.

[caption #2071]
Leo: Kefka!
<D>I can no longer overlook your behavior!

[caption #2072]
Kefka: Hee, hee_!
How 'bout a little Magitek mayhem!

[caption #2073]
Kefka: I know just how badly you want to become Magicite for me, so time to grant your wish!

[caption #2074]
Kefka: Whoa! Yes, I feel some incredible magic power here, today! Wave after wave of pure, magical energy_

[caption #2075]
Kefka: My, oh, my, if it isn't the Espers. I wasn't expecting you, but I'll do my best to give you a warm welcome.<EOP>
Especially if you've come bearing gifts of Magicite, I couldn't possibly refuse!

[caption #2076]
Kefka: First, let's neutralize that pesky magical power of yours.

[caption #2077]
Kefka: Now, little Espers_
Entertain me.

[caption #2078]
Kefka: This is ridiculous!
I had no idea you were such wimps! <EOP>
Fighting you like this is no fun at all, so let's wrap this up.

[caption #2079]
Kefka: Eh?!
You wanna take me on?
Fine. Here I am_

[caption #2080]
Kefka: G'ha ha ha_
I think I have plenty of Magicite for the time being_<EOP>
that is, until I get my hands on the ultimate treasure behind your Sealed Gate!

[caption #2081]
It hurts_

[caption #2082]
Curse the Empire_Curse Kefka!

[caption #2083]
Are the Espers_ all dead?

[caption #2084]
Mayor: I can only take some comfort in the fact that there were so few casualties.

[caption #2085]
<A0>: General Leo_

[caption #2086]
<A0>: People only seem to want power. Do they really want to be like me?

[caption #2087]
<A0>: I_I wanted to learn so much more from you_

[caption #2088]
Interceptor!?
That's a nasty wound!

[caption #2089]
<A1>: We not only lost Leo, but <A3>, too_
<D>Curse the Empire!

[caption #2090]
<A1>: This'll have to do_

[caption #2091]
<A6>: You're so sweet_

[caption #2092]
<A8>: I'll go with you.

[caption #2093]
<A1>: If this happened here, I'm worried about <A4> and the others back in the Empire_<EOP>
<A0>: I wish I could say they were safe_

[caption #2094]
<A9>: The Empire's betrayed us!
We were so close to falling into their trap.

[caption #2095]
<A2>: We were luckily able to escape in time thanks to King <A4>'s inside information.

[caption #2096]
<A1>: Guess it's good to be the king.

[caption #2097]
<A4>: I got to know the lady who brought us tea. She just couldn't help but divulge the whole plot.

[caption #2098]
<A5>: _ I guess your [specialty] does have its uses_

[caption #2099]
<A4>: I don't put on the moves just because there's a woman there. What sort of reprobate do you take me for?<EOP>
It was a matter of courtesy, my dear brother. Common courtesy.

[caption #2100]
<A1>: The Espers are gone_
<D>Kefka reduced them all to Magicite_<EOP>
He almost got General Leo, too.
I don't know what Leo's planning now, but he didn't want us involved.

[caption #2101]
<A2>: _ So once again the Empire exploited Sir Leo's honor to wipe out an entire people_<EOP>
He is a man of fine principle. Surely now he has washed his hands of the Empire.

[caption #2102]
<A4>: Anyway, we need to rethink our strategy. Let's return to the airship.

[caption #2103]
<A7>: May I accompany you?

[caption #2104]
<A4>: Who're you?

[caption #2105]
<A1>: He's one of this town's citizens.

[caption #2106]
<A0>: He's descended from the ancient Mages. He'll be a big help.

[caption #2107]
<A7>: The Empire is dabbling in powers it doesn't understand. I can't just stand idly by.

[caption #2108]
<A8>: I'm coming along, too.

[caption #2109]
<A5>: Yeah, right kid!

[caption #2110]
<A8>: What?
Who is this muscle-head?<EOP>
<A5>: Kid's got quite a lip!

[caption #2111]
<A8>: Grr!
I'm gonna paint your portrait!

[caption #2112]
Uwaaa! S_stop!

[caption #2113]
<A7>: All right all ready!
If you insist_
<A8>: That's better!

[caption #2114]
<A8>: What's wrong, lover boy?
<A4>: How old are you?
<A8>: 10_why?

[caption #2115]
<A4>: So not even legal_
That one's off-limits.

[caption #2116]
Espers_ We will help you find peace_

[caption #2117]
Gestahl: Fuwa, ha, ha!
So this is the power of the Warring Triad!<EOP>
With this and my Magicite, the world will bow before me!!!

[caption #2118]
<A7>: The beginning of all magic_ The Warring Triad.
<A0>: Those statues are them?<EOP>
<A7>: It's said they turned themselves to stone while facing each other in order to neutralize their powers.<EOP>
<A7>: If their three mutual gazes are ever broken, the resulting imbalance would destroy the world_<EOP>
<A0>: What?!

[caption #2119]
Quick! Back to the airship!!

[caption #2120]
<A9>: The Empire's after the sealed gate! They're looking for some statues or something.<EOP>
<A7>: No!!!

[caption #2121]
<A6>: What's wrong, <A0>?<EOP>
<A0>: The island_
The world is groaning in pain_

[caption #2122]
Gestahl: Those foolish Espers! To think they opened the gate themselves! The Warring Triad should be just ahead.<EOP>
If we can just get our hands on them, we'll have everything we ever dreamed of!

[caption #2123]
Gestahl: Come quickly!

[caption #2124]
<A0>: I'm going! I can't let Yura and the other Espers' stolen magic be used for evil purposes!<EOP>
<A6>: Count me in, too! Emperor Gestahl and Kefka have acted unchecked for far too long!<EOP>
<A9>: Then let's jump onto that thing!<EOP>
Only 3 allowed in your party.
The others must stay on board.

[caption #2125]
Only 3 allowed in your party.
The others must stay on board.

Uh, oh!!!
The Imperial Airforce (IAF)!<EOP>
We're surrounded!
Gotta engage them head-on!

[caption #2127]
Something_
curious_approaches!!

[caption #2128]
Kefka, Gestahl_and the Warring Triad are just ahead.

[caption #2129]
<A3>: Curse the Empire! Tried to off me the moment I'd outlived my usefulness.<EOP>
[We were convinced you were dead!]

[caption #2130]
<A3>: Is Interceptor all right?<EOP>
[He's fine.
Come on, let's go!]

[caption #2131]
<A3>: Forget about me.<EOP>
[We can't just leave you!]

[caption #2132]
<A3>: I sold my skills to the Empire_
I have no right to fight together with you.

[caption #2133]
<A3>: So we meet again.

[caption #2134]
The airship's below!<EOP>
Do you wish to return?
<C> (No)
<C> (Yes)

You came?]<EOP>
<A6>: I've got a score to settle with the Empire, so I tagged along behind you!

[caption #2137]
Gestahl: Fwa, ha, ha_
So you've come to perish together. But you're too late!<EOP>
Behold! The Warring Triad!

[caption #2138]
Gestahl: Ooh! I've got goose bumps! What power_<EOP>
<A6>: Emperor Gestahl!
Please, stop this madness!

[caption #2139]
Gestahl: <A6>, come to me.
You alone are special.<EOP>
You who have been blessed with a Magitek infusion.
You who have strayed but returned to us once before.<EOP>
I shall task you and Kefka with creating progeny for my new Magitek Empire!

[caption #2140]
Kefka: Kill them yourself and your betrayal will be all but forgiven.

[caption #2141]
Kefka: Take this sword!
Kill them!

[caption #2142]
Gestahl: Think of it, <A6>!
We could rule the world together!

[caption #2143]
<A6>: Power only breeds war_ <D>
We'd be better off without it!

Kefka: Acknowledge me, dammit!

[caption #2151]
Kefka: You'd better listen to me!
Stop making me look foolish and show me your power!

[caption #2152]
Gestahl: Kefka, stop it!
If we revive the Warring Triad the world will be wiped out_<EOP>
There's no sense in that!

[caption #2153]
Gestahl: Horror will engulf the world_

[caption #2154]
<A6>: Stop it, Kefka!

[caption #2155]
<A6>: Kefka_ don't_<EOP>
If you disrupt their balance, their power will go haywire!

Kefka: Noooo!

[caption #2166]

     On that day, <D>the world

[caption #2167]
Cid: <A6>_at last_!

[caption #2168]
Cid: You're finally awake!
<A6>: How_long was I asleep?<EOP>
Cid: For one year, actually_
I thought you were out for good.<EOP>
<A6>: A whole year_
<D>You've watched over me the whole time?

[caption #2169]
Cid: Yes, and I'm about out of energy.

[caption #2170]
Cid: We're on a tiny, deserted island.<EOP>
After the world crumbled, I awoke to find us washed up here.<EOP>
<A6>: The world_!
So, it wasn't just a dream.

[caption #2171]
<A6>: Where are my friends? Where's <A1>_?<EOP>
Cid: I don't know. 
I know nothing of what's beyond this island_<EOP>
For all I know, this island is all that's left and the rest of the world sank below the sea.<EOP>
Cid: Since that day, the world's continued its slide into ruin. Animals and plants are dying_<EOP>
The few other survivors gave up hope and flung themselves off the cliffs to the north.

[caption #2172]
<A6>: My friends_
they're probably all gone_

[caption #2173]
Cid: Don't lose heart, <A6>.
You're the closest thing I have left to family in this world.<EOP>
We could live out our lives peacefully here.
<A6>: I suppose so, Cid_
<D>Or should I say, Granddad?!
May I call you that?<EOP>
Cid: Gramps, eh?
I'm overwhelmed! All of a sudden I have a granddaughter!
<D>Cough_ <D>Wheeze_<EOP>
<A6>: My long-lost Granddad_

[caption #2174]
Cid: Ha, ha_hack_cough!
<A6>: Hey, are you hungry?<EOP>
Cid: I_haven't eaten in 3 or so days, ever since I became ill.<EOP>
<A6>: What would you like?<EOP>
Cid: Well, unless I ask for fish,
I won't get anything!
That's all there is here!
<A6>: I'll go catch some.

[caption #2175]
Cid: I feel much better!
Thanks, <A6>!

I feel a little better!

I can't bear this any longer_

Cid: My worst nightmare is to think of you alone here on this wretched island_hack_wheeze!!<EOP>
I wish you could have found your friends_
I would have very much liked to have met them_<EOP>
<A6>: It's all right, Granddad. At least we still have each other.

Cid: <A6>_
You must leave this place.
You have to find your friends!<EOP>

But I'll bring 'em all back to meet you!<EOP>
Cid: That <A1> fellow, too, no doubt_

[caption #2193]
<A6>: I'll keep on living for the both of us, Granddad_

[caption #2194]
Cid: Those others who were here_<EOP>
One after another they gave up hope and flung themselves off the cliffs to the north.

[caption #2195]
<A6>: Everyone's dead_
Even <A1>'s gone even though he said he'd protect me_<EOP>
This really is the end of the world_

[caption #2196]
<A6>: Phew_
So you protected me? Even though I've given up all hope_

[caption #2197]
<A6>: A bandana???

Is the person who bandaged your wound still alive?
Please, tell me__

<A6>: He's alive_
<D><A1>'s still alive!!!

[caption #2199]
<A6>: There may still be a glimmer of hope yet. My friends are out there waiting for me.<EOP>
I have to go find them!

[caption #2200]
Thanks for saving my child!

[caption #2201]
Kefka's always watchin'_
Brrrr, creeps you out just thinking about it_

[caption #2202]
Anyone who opposes Kefka is doomed. He uses his [Light of Judgment] from high atop his tower to burn whole towns.

[caption #2203]
I saw it! Kefka used a light beam to burn the village of Mobliz, to the east.<EOP>
Most of the adults there perished trying to save their children_

[caption #2204]
The [Serpent Trench] used to be deep under water.
Now it's above sea level.<EOP>
Some [Cult of Kefka] members have built a tower there_

[caption #2205]
Many monsters nowadays attack with [Zombie], [Petrify] and the like. Have you equipped suitable Relics?

[caption #2206]
To the east you'll find the [Serpent Trench.] Further east you'll find the village of Mobliz.<EOP>
Boy, the Light of Judgment really fried that town_

[caption #2207]
Head north on the Serpent Trench and you'll reach Nikeah. Ships still sail from there.

[caption #2208]
Heeeeee_
I've never been more frightened!

[caption #2209]
My child's inside!
I'm begging you! Save him!

[caption #2210]
This is what Kefka does simply for opposing him_

[caption #2211]
There are monsters inside! They keep petrifying everyone who goes in to help. You using suitable Relics?

[caption #2212]
We resisted Kefka, so he unleashed his Light of Judgment on us!

[caption #2213]
Hurry, or the house'll collapse!

[caption #2214]
<A4>: <A5>!<EOP>
<A5>: Brother! You're all right!

You're alive!

[caption #2221]
<A5>: But of course!
You think a minor thing like the end of the world was gonna do me in?

[caption #2222]
<A6>: I thought everyone was gone_
I had given up all hope_<EOP>
But_ <D>fortunately, I was wrong! Now I know they're all alive! We need to find everyone! Then_

[caption #2223]
We weren't sure anyone else survived_
We'd started to give up hope_<EOP>
But_ <D>we can't give up! They must be alive! We need to find everyone! Then_

[caption #2224]
<A5>: I know, I know_
We smash Kefka, and deliver peace unto the world_

[caption #2225]
I beg you!!
Please help!

[caption #2226]
All I can do now is restore your health.
Please_go back inside and save my child!!

[caption #2227]
[I'm scared_!]
[Don't worry, you're safe now.]

[caption #2228]
Ever since the world fell apart, the port's been blocked by rubble. No ships come anymore.

[caption #2229]
First the Empire crushed us under its thumb, now Kefka's pickin' off the rest of us.<EOP>
Nowhere to run. He'll get us all eventually.

[caption #2230]
One o' these nights I'm gonna catch that ship coming in!
Always seems to come when I'm asleep_

[caption #2231]
I hear some nights, an old Imperial transport ship drifts into port 'n leaves cargo on the dock.<EOP>
But ain't no one ever seen the crew!

[caption #2232]
Kefka crushed every last trace of the old Gestahlian Empire.<EOP>
Any remaining soldiers must be either dead or in hiding.

[caption #2233]
The economy is falling into ruin along with the rest of the world.<EOP>
Lots of folks are resorting to bartering just to get necessary supplies.

[caption #2234]
This town has just barely been able to hang on thanks to the [donations] from the ghost ship.<EOP>
It's good to know there's still a few good people left in the world.

[caption #2235]
Some time ago, a man came through looking for a way to scale Kefka's tower.<EOP>
His muscles were so big, I'll bet he could just climb it freestyle!

[caption #2236]
Ohh, I want to sleep, but I don't want to miss the ghost ship if it comes back tonight!

[caption #2237]
With the port blocked, the town's supplies are drying up.<EOP>
Only the [ghost ship] has ever made it in, but good luck catching it!

[caption #2238]
Oh_I think back on how nice the world used to be_

[caption #2239]
_and realize it'll never be the same again_

We're all glad to see you!

I feel like a million gil!
All right, make room for me!

The members of the [Cult of Kefka] live in this tower.

But you can only use magic here. If your magic's not up to snuff, you're sure to get snuffed yourself!

Beneath the Desert of Figaro lies an ancient castle_<EOP>
_loaded with treasure.
By the way, an old man who lives in the Weapon Shop in Narshe is looking for you_

[caption #2249]
No use talking to them. They've sold their souls to Kefka.
They pray to him daily_

The moment I arrived, I felt needed_

Duane: You can't take <A0> away!

Katarin: Duane_ <D><EOP>
Please excuse him. It's just that if <A0> goes, she takes with her the very spirit of our survival_

[caption #2263]
<A0>: I don't know why I put in this much effort for them for so long_<EOP>
No one made me protect them.
I just had this weird feeling.
And then_<EOP>
The moment that feeling took root, I couldn't leave_

[caption #2264]
<A0>: I feel like I'm on the verge of figuring something out. But I can't explain it_<EOP>
And the more I try to understand it, the less inclined I am to fight.

[caption #2265]
Help!!! Run!!!
Phunbaba's coming!!

[caption #2266]

Wake up!
Uh, oh_here it comes!!

<A0>: I've really lost it_
My fighting edge_

Are you okay?!

[caption #2270]
<A0>: I'm staying here.
As you can see, I can't be of any help to you.<EOP>
And besides, the children really need me.
[But <A0>_!]

Seems they escaped from Figaro Castle's dungeon.

The dungeon ended up getting connected to a sandworm nest.<EOP>
We followed their tunnels back to the surface and escaped.

[caption #2336]
Our last boss bit the dust that day. Now our boss is Gerad, who we met here in town.

The boss wants to sneak into Figaro Castle. He wants to get our booty back from the storage room there.

We'll enter da castle through a secret cave dat only we knows about!

[caption #2350]
That sweet little girl stopped coming around right after the world ended_

[caption #2351]
I'm so relieved the Empire's finally outta here!

[caption #2352]
Now all these thieves are demanding all our time.
Phew_I'm exhausted.

[caption #2353]
I don't have a hometown to return to anymore.

Oh, jump on the turtle_<EOP>
Oops_never mind.

Souvenir of the Empire, anyone?!

[caption #2360]
Gerad: You still here?!

[caption #2361]
We're storming Figaro Castle! That treasure's rightfully ours!

[caption #2362]
We won't stop 'till we get our treasure back!

[caption #2363]
We can't just wallow in despair.
We have to rebuild the town.

[caption #2364]
They may be thieves, but they've got that glint in their eye that says they've got something to live for.<EOP>
That means we can't give up, either!

[caption #2365]
For each life lost, a new one arrives to fill the void!<EOP>
Okay!
Nothing's gonna stop us!

[caption #2366]
Oh_!
That person!

[caption #2367]
Whoa!
Am I dizzy!

[caption #2368]
If the [Light of Judgment] should burn our town down 100 times, we'll rebuild it 101 times!

[caption #2369]
Did you hear that Duncan's alive? His wife said so!

[caption #2370]
Some guy came through a while ago looking for a secret treasure of resurrection.

The boss of these thieves is on the second floor of the inn.

<A4>: Well, I heard that Figaro had had an accident.
I wanted to help, but it was buried.<EOP>
Then I heard that those idiots had managed to escape the castle.<EOP>
<A6>: You needed to use them_<EOP>
<A4>: Bingo. I had to keep it a secret that I was the king of Figaro until they led me to their secret cave.<EOP>
<A6>: Amazing, considering that you threw most of 'em in jail to begin with!

[caption #2387]
<A5>: Don't treat us like strangers anymore!

[caption #2392]
<A0>: Are you okay letting them go? What about the treasure_?<EOP>
<A4>: It's completely worthless.<EOP>
Besides, Kefka's the one we need to worry about.
Those guys haven't committed any serious crimes_<EOP>
<A6>: Come with us, then_?
<A4>: Once I've confirmed the kingdom is secure, absolutely!

Let's show him some of OUR Esper magic!

1000 years in the past, a battle was waged here_

Next, your opponent will appear. Choose someone from your party to fight this opponent.<EOP>
A one-on-one auto-battle will then take place. The item you wagered covers your participation fee.<EOP>
If you win, you'll be rewarded with an even better item! That's all there is to it!

<A0>: What's wrong? What happened?
<A9>: I'm still just a lowly gambler at heart_<EOP>
Just a man who could do as he pleased without a care.
This kind of world is harsh on a man like that_<EOP>
Plus I've lost my wings_

[caption #2448]
<A6>: But before the world collapsed, you fought alongside us with all your heart! You were absolutely fearless_<EOP>
<A9>: But now_
I've lost my one dream_<EOP>
<A6>: But precisely BECAUSE the world is the way it is now, isn't that reason enough to chase a new dream?<EOP>
The dream of taking this world back_!

<A9>: Heh_
Guess you've got a point.
Wanna come with me?
To find my new dream?

I needed that.
Now, let's go visit Daryl's Tomb.

[caption #2451]

<A9>: What are you doing trying to push this ship to its limits?!

[caption #2465]
Daryl: If something should happen to me, the Falcon's yours!

[caption #2466]
<A9>: Nonsense!
I'll win the Falcon from you when I whip you in a race!<EOP>
<A9>: So nothing better happen to you until I do!
Daryl: Hmph, say what you like.

[caption #2467]
<A9>: There's nothing like flying!

[caption #2468]
<A9>: I can't be the fastest man in the world anymore if I leave my wings clipped.<EOP>
But this might just give me a new dream to pursue.<EOP>
          The Falcon.

[caption #2469]
Daryl: How long do you plan on trailing behind me?
Pull ahead if you can!

[caption #2470]
Daryl: Or are you just that entranced by my rudder?

[caption #2471]
<A9>: Listen to you!

[caption #2472]
Daryl: This time's for real.
I'm going to break every record!<EOP>
I'll be known as the woman who flew closest to the stars!

[caption #2473]
<A9>: Be back before sunset! I'll be waiting for you on our hill.

[caption #2474]

  The wreck of the Falcon was
    found a full year later,
      in a distant land_

[caption #2475]
<A9>: I restored the craft, and then put it to rest down here.

[caption #2476]
<A4>: This is THE Falcon?

[caption #2477]
<A4>: This is a dream come true for all of us!<EOP>
<A6>: This is exactly what we need to take on Kefka!<EOP>
<A4>: The Falcon can reach his tower by air, and we can infiltrate from the top!

[caption #2478]
<A9>: Yeah. And it'll let us find our friends.

[caption #2479]
<A0>: Right.
We've gotten our dreams back.
They all should, too!

[caption #2480]
<A6>: A bird! What if_

[caption #2481]

Now I'll be able to go play at the art-lover's house again!

Every once in a while something very rare is sold here, so don't miss out on it.

I saw the Emperor recently! <D>
A painting of him, that is_
It's in Owzer's house.

[caption #2692]
Lots of opera fans in this town!

[caption #2693]
Lately I've seen a lot of carrier pigeons flying towards Maranda. Who can be sending all the letters?

[caption #2694]
The other day I read Owzer's diary. It was just laying there!

[caption #2695]
A while ago a little girl entered the art-collector's house_

[caption #2696]
Oh, so you weren't a ghost.

[caption #2697]
I went up to talk to Owzer,
but he's nowhere to be found.

[caption #2698]
But it's a lot different from the old world map_

[caption #2699]

          Received the

Bought a new stairway lamp at the Item Shop. Expensive, but one flip of the switch and everything's bright and cheery.

[caption #2709]
I invited over an artist from Kohlingen. About as talented as a bucket_

[caption #2710]
Something's happening to me.
It started when I had that picture painted_<EOP>
And I've started hearing odd noises coming from downstairs.

[caption #2711]

    The diary ends here_

Relax! The monster croaked!

[caption #2718]
Owzer: Thanks for saving the day! This picture's more precious to me than my own life!<EOP>
<A8>: Huh?!
What are you talking about?

[caption #2719]
[Now_what was a monster doing in that picture?!]<EOP>
Owzer: It all started when I bought a stone at the Auction House.<EOP>
I took one look at it and suddenly felt I needed a portrait of Starlet.<EOP>
I asked several artists, but none could muster enough skill.<EOP>
It was then that I heard about <A8>'s amazing ability.
I brought her here, and put her to work.<EOP>
But while she was painting, that thing came along_ <D>
It must have been enticed here by that stone.

[caption #2720]
Where is the stone_?<EOP>
Owzer: The stone? <D>
Over on that bookshelf.

[caption #2721]
Owzer: Hey, not that.
That's priceless!!<EOP>
But_seeing as you saved my hide, I'll give it to you as well.

[caption #2722]

Aged Man: But now that you mention it, I once had a terrible dream. <D> In it, a demon-child was born!<EOP>
I grabbed the creature, and rushed off to the Veldt with it_
<D>It was crying like crazy when I arrived on the Veldt.<EOP>

Aged Man: Suddenly the crying stopped. I turned around and saw a frightful monster_<EOP>
Hideous! Still gives me the shakes.
<A5>: I give up_

Aged Man: But you, young man, your parents must be proud of you! I still have dreams of that demon child_<EOP>
Frightening_

One day, a man working for an aristocrat in Jidoor came and took that young woman back with him!

[caption #2847]
I saw a monster floating in the sky! It looked just like a stingray.

All the fun places are gone now.

For the first time in 50 years, Ebot's Rock is above water!
Probably got exposed by the global calamity.<EOP>
Head north of town if you want to see it.

Gungho: Is that you,
<A7>?
Have you come back to hunt Hidon?

[caption #2851]
I've got <A7> on my side now, but what a monumental bag of hot air!

[caption #2852]
Gungho: He'll never change.
That's who he is!

[caption #2853]
When you were younger you hunted Hidon, the legendary monster. But you quit before you found it_

[caption #2854]
<A7>: I didn't quit, I just__!
*mumble* *mumble*<EOP>
Besides, you can only find that beast on Ebot's Rock, which sunk below the sea.<EOP>
Gungho: You never could give me an honest answer.

Gungho: What a buffoon!!

But it feels like forever.

Gungho: It was_Hidon, the beast you and I used to hunt.
I almost had it_

Gungho: Oooh_cough, cough_

[caption #2863]
Gungho: <A7>_
Please_you must avenge me_

<A7>: You took on Hidon_?

<A8>: Gramps!
Why are you hesitating!

<A7>: Well_ <D>at my age I didn't think I'd get to chase the abandoned dream of my youth_

<A8>: Just a minute!
You don't think you're going alone, do you?

<A7>: I must face the monster of my past. It is my obsession, not yours.

<A8>: But Grandpa!
Stubbornness alone won't help you!<EOP>
You're my Grandfather.
I can't just sit idly by and watch you go.

<A7>: Sorry, <A8>.
I'm so grateful that you care!<EOP>

Now, about my [wounds]_

[caption #2905]
<A8>: Nah, I knew you were faking it.<EOP>
But thanks to that, Grandpa got the nerve to actually DO something instead of blow hot air.<EOP>

How long are you going to keep destroying things, Kefka?!<EOP>
Kefka: I've tapped into the ultimate power. Observe_!

[caption #2987]
Kefka: Such magnificent power!
You are like insects to me!

[caption #2988]
Kefka: I will exterminate everyone, and everything!

[caption #2989]
People will keep rebuilding the things you take from them!

[caption #2990]
Kefka: And those things will eventually be destroyed, too.<EOP>
Why do people rebuild things they know are going to be destroyed?<EOP>
Why do people cling to life when they know they can't live forever?<EOP>
Think how meaningless each of your lives is!

[caption #2991]
It's not the net result of one's life that's important!<EOP>
It's what you live for now_ What you can accomplish in the moment_<EOP>
What you can protect_

[caption #2992]
Isn't it enough for people to discover those things during the time they're alive?

Kefka, you don't know what you're doing! Stop!

Kefka: I command the greatest
power in the universe!
The rest of you are just dirt!<EOP>
No, less than dirt!
Less than what's less than dirt!

Kefka: I will destroy everything_
And create a world of death!

Life, and dreams, will continue to be born!

Destroy! Destroy! Destroy!!

[caption #3014]
We will not allow you to harm another living thing.

Kefka: Hee, hee, hee!!
But what fun is destruction if no [precious] lives are lost!

[caption #3016]
It's over, Kefka!

Kefka: So be it.
If that's what you want so badly,
then I'll destroy you all!

Kefka: Those soldiers were just disposable pawns.<D>
The only one of any value is the girl.<EOP>
Leo: She's a human being, Kefka.

[caption #3086]
Kefka: If you say so.<EOP>
Either way, a weapon like her shouldn't be allowed to fall into enemy hands.

Leo: [Weapon]_

[caption #3088]
Leo: Kefka, what's the meaning of this?! Those were our own men!

[caption #3089]
Gestahl: Fwa ha ha, what a magnificent demonstration. You have trained the girl up well, Kefka.

[caption #3090]
Leo: But, sire, was this truly necessary?<EOP>
Those men had bravely served our country, and <A0>_

[caption #3091]
Gestahl: Worry not, Leo, this is but a small price to pay for the power that will elevate our nation to greatness.<EOP>
Magic is a force beyond your comprehension.<D>

Rich Man: I just feel like I betrayed everyone, though_

Leo: Sometimes suffering is unavoidable_
Often all we can do is manage its extent.

[caption #3102]
Leo: If the Empire had proceeded with its originally-planned armed invasion,<EOP>
countless more would have died on both sides.<EOP>
Thus, this is the optimal outcome.

[caption #3103]
Rich Man: At least the king was able to make it out before all this went down.

[caption #3104]
Leo: The king?
King <A4> was here?

Rich Man: When is he not?<EOP>
Leo: _

[caption #3106]
Leo: Perhaps it would be best if I question the townspeople.<EOP>
Thank you again.

[caption #3107]
<A3>: I hear you paid off the aristocrat to take this town without a fight.<EOP>
If you're still feeling generous, I might have information on that girl you're after.

[caption #3108]
Leo: I am not [after] her, I am merely concerned for her well-being.

[caption #3109]
Leo: Was she here? Was she in good health?

[caption #3110]
Leo: _Very well, take this.<EOP>
There can be more depending on the value of the information you provide.

[caption #3111]
<A3>: A girl passed through here not long ago.<EOP>
She was accompanied by the King of Figaro and a man who looked like a petty thief.<EOP>
She seemed timid and confused, however appeared to be with her companions willingly.

[caption #3112]
They left for Mount Kolts.  There may be a hidden stronghold in the mountains beyond.<EOP>
For an additional fee, I can return her to you.<EOP>
Leo: _

[caption #3113]
Leo: No, that won't be necessary.<EOP>
If she is truly acting of her own free will, I have no desire to have her robbed of it again.

[caption #3114]
Instead, I have a different request:<EOP>
Follow them,<D> watch after them,<D> see that she is safe,<EOP>
and make periodic reports back to me.

[caption #3115]
I take it this amount is sufficient for such a job?

[caption #3116]
<A3>: Come, Interceptor.

[caption #3117]
Leo: I have new intel that there may be a Returner base in the Sabre Mountains.<EOP>
Gather soldiers and set up a blockade.

[caption #3118]
I must return to the front at Doma. The conflict there is escalating and I cannot be away for long.<EOP>
I trust you to manage things here in my absence.

[caption #3119]
Leo: War does not suit you, <A0>.<EOP>
I hope you are able to escape from this, too.

[caption #3120]
Leo: What about generals?

[caption #3121]
No? You sure?

[caption #3122]
Okay_

[caption #3123]
Keep up the good work young man. I'm sure your grandfather appreciates it.

[caption #3124]
Leo: Take a break, soldier. You've earned it.<EOP>
Soldier: Of course! Thank you, sir!

[caption #3125]
General! Let me test my strength against you!

[caption #3126]
Ha ha, should've known I'd stand no chance against you!
Gonna have to take a breather_

[caption #3127]
The town's secure, General.

[caption #3128]
Glad I didn't have to use this on civilians_

[caption #3129]
A toast to our victory, General!

[caption #3130]
General, you're a music buff, right?<EOP>
Why don't you play us a celebratory song on the record player there?

[caption #3131]
Much better!

[caption #3132]
You're looking for a girl? You Imperials took everything from us, now you're after our women?!

[caption #3133]
Uh oh, is someone in trouble? It wasn't me!

[caption #3134]
A girl? Sorry, you're not my type.

[caption #3135]
I have nothing to sell to the likes of you!

[caption #3136]
No cheating!

[caption #3137]
Duncan's Wife: I'm sorry, I can't help you.
You see, my husband recently passed away_

[caption #3138]
Leo: My condolences, ma'am.

[caption #3139]
Did we_?

[caption #3140]
Duncan's Wife: No_ <D>Though perhaps I would have preferred if he'd died fighting you.

[caption #3141]
You're not much older than my husband's students.
Why is this the path you chose?

[caption #3142]
Leo: Please understand that I mean neither you nor this town any ill will.

[caption #3143]
I chose this path simply because I feared the alternative would cause even more harm.<EOP>
I'm afraid that is the only excuse I have.

[caption #3144]
Come on, General, fight serious!
You let me win that one!

[caption #3145]
<A1>: Why were you locked up like that, anyway?

[caption #3146]
<A6>: My subordinates don't trust me. They see my powers as a threat. <EOP>
Other infusion recipients lost their minds and souls to the process, so I suppose their fear is warranted.

[caption #3147]
One of them is plotting something heinous. <EOP>
My speaking out against it was all the excuse they needed to brand me a traitor. <EOP>
<A1>: Well, I won't turn on you like that. I promise.

[caption #3148]
<A6>: ...Anyway, this way leads out.
We should get moving before they realize I'm gone.

[caption #3149]
<A0>: Moogles!

[caption #3150]
They're so cute and fluffy_
I want to pet them all!! <EOP>
Banon: Ho, ho, girls will like what they like.

[caption #3151]
<A4>: Really? <D>
Because I've never seen <A0> react so strongly to <D> well <D> anything_

[caption #3152]
<A0>: I'm sorry_
Is it strange?

[caption #3153]
<A4>: No, no. I'm the one who should be sorry.
I'm just glad to see you coming out of your shell.

[caption #3154]
<A0>: It's true that I still have no strong feelings about the war, the Empire, or the Returners_ <EOP>
I come with you because I don't know what else to do.

[caption #3155]
But I hope if I'm able to talk to that Esper, things will start making sense. <EOP>
Banon: Then let's stop dilly-dallying and get to that Esper!

[caption #3156]
For example, the acclaimed opera penned by-

[caption #3157]
Huh?
I swear I heard him whisper something_<EOP>
[Please stop him_]

[caption #3158]
Kefka: NO ONE CARES!<EOP>
If they offer aid to the Returners, may as well just get rid of 'em all.<EOP>
Leo: They're human beings, Kefka, just like you and me.
Please remember that.

[caption #3159]
What the_?<EOP>
Why even bother?

[caption #3160]

             Found 1 GP!

[caption #3161]
Leo: I came as quickly as I could, my liege, per your summons regarding General <A6>_

[caption #3162]
Gestahl: Ah, yes, that matter.
A shame, really.

[caption #3163]
Leo: You mean she's already_?

[caption #3164]
Gestahl: No. <D>
I received word that she escaped and embedded herself within a Returner faction.<EOP>
Whether it is as a traitor or a double agent remains to be seen.

[caption #3165]
So she's safe_

[caption #3166]
Leo: I see_
I cannot fathom a reason for her to turn on us so abruptly_<EOP>
But acting as a spy doesn't sit well with me, either_

[caption #3167]
Gestahl: When dealing with lawless rebels, sometimes underhanded tactics are necessary, Leo.

[caption #3168]
Leo: As you say, sire.<EOP>
However, I would like to continue to execute my duties without resorting to such measures.<EOP>
If the matter with General <A6> is settled for now, I shall return to Doma.

[caption #3169]
Gestahl: That won't be necessary.

[caption #3170]
Leo: My liege?

[caption #3171]
Gestahl: Doma is now under our complete control.
It fell while you were away.

[caption #3172]
Leo: But_ how?<EOP>
For three years we have been unable to penetrate their defenses, so for it to fall so quickly_

[caption #3173]
Your Majesty, I must know how this was accomplished!

[caption #3174]
Gestahl: __

[caption #3175]
I myself am not aware of the full details, and Kefka has already left for another mission.

[caption #3176]
However, I do know that he was able to accomplish in a day what you failed to do in three years.

[caption #3177]
I have already lost a Magitek Elite and now a general to the Returners.<EOP>
I need to know that I can still rely on you, Leo.

[caption #3178]
Leo: Of course, my liege!
My heart beats only for my country's sake!

[caption #3179]
Gestahl: Good, good.<EOP>
You have valuable qualities that Kefka lacks. <D>
I would hate to lose you, too.

[caption #3180]
Leo: I am humbled by your praise, Your Majesty.<EOP>
I pledge that I shall continue to live by the example I wish to set for our people.

[caption #3181]
<A0>: Even after everything we've gone through together, I still can't say I feel anything [special] for anyone here_

[caption #3182]
You said yourself that your heart can't be moved.<EOP>
Does having magic_ <D>keep you from feeling?

[caption #3183]
<A6>: __ If it does, all the better for it, I'd say.

[caption #3184]
<A0>: __

[caption #3185]
Kefka: Oh my, an Esper, a runaway puppet, and a traitor general all in one place!
This must be my lucky day!

[caption #3186]
Since you left them unattended, I helped myself to some of your soldiers, General <A6>. <D>
Hope you don't mind!<EOP>
I'm sure a few of them have a bone to pick with you for so selfishly abandoning them.

[caption #3187]
Don't let me get in your way, fellas!
Have at them!

[caption #3188]
<A2>: Wh_ What dark sorcery is this?!

[caption #3189]
A castle is the firm bedrock of its nation! It cannot move!
Preposterous!

[caption #3190]
<A4>: It's called [technology], my friend.
Perhaps you should look into it!

[caption #3191]
<A5>: Gya ha ha!
Yeah, Figaro's technology is pretty incredible!

[caption #3192]
Leo: It is an impressive technological feat!
Surely it can be used to improve quality of life!

[caption #3193]
<A6>: Hmph_ The Empire stereotypes the Domans as luddites.<EOP>
I thought it was an exaggeration, but_

[caption #3194]
<A9>: Ha ha, I prefer to travel far above ground, thank you very much!

[caption #3195]
<A0>: Dark sorcery?
No_ I don't think this is magic_

[caption #3196]

Leo: Welcome back, General <A6>.<EOP>
I am glad to see you are unharmed, though I wish our reunion was under better circumstances.

[caption #3213]
Why did you abandon your post?<EOP>
I have heard so many rumors, but I wanted to hear an answer straight from you.

[caption #3214]
<A6>: __ Because what the Empire is doing is wrong.<EOP>
Crushing towns_ <D>
forcing their people to join our ranks_<EOP>
Poisoning kingdoms_

[caption #3215]
Leo: I can genuinely sympathize with how you feel_

[caption #3216]
But it was precisely because I was NOT there that such atrocities were able to happen.<EOP>
I agree that Kefka has become even more brazen,<EOP>
which is why it is even more imperative that I remain here and hold a firm line.<EOP>
I must maintain the Emperor's favor<EOP>
if I am to remain in a position where I can most effectively protect our people from Kefka's influence.

[caption #3217]
Even if maintaining that favor means_ <D>overlooking certain things_

[caption #3218]
_ Did you see <A0>?
Is she all right?<EOP>
<A6>: She's_

[caption #3219]
She transformed into_ something_ that looked like an Esper.<EOP>
She's been in a catatonic state in Zozo ever since_<EOP>
An Esper there told us that one of the Espers in the Facility might be able to help her, which is why we came.

[caption #3220]
Leo: __ I see_<EOP>
<A6>: You don't sound surprised.

[caption #3221]
Leo: _ I was 12 years old, still in the Academy, when the Espers were first brought to Vector.

[caption #3222]
Gestahl: Behold, cadets, these creatures represent the future of our glorious Empire!

[caption #3223]
Kefka: I thought this was supposed to be a demonstration for elite graduates.<EOP>
Why is there some kid here?

[caption #3224]
Commander: Yes, sir, this is Cadet Leo, sir.<EOP>
He may be young, but he is a prodigy in both combat and leadership. I'm sure he will serve the Empire well.

[caption #3225]
Leo: My liege, it is an honor to be here in your presence.

[caption #3226]
Gestahl: Oh, very obedient, too.
I'm impressed.
You indeed have potential.

[caption #3227]
Kefka: Don't forget, Your Majesty, as soon as everything is ready, I'M going to be first!

[caption #3228]

                  Waah!

[caption #3229]
Leo: Is that a baby?<EOP>
Gestahl: Indeed. She was recovered from those monsters.<EOP>
Leo: What about her parents?

[caption #3230]
Kefka: Quiet, you!

[caption #3231]
Gestahl: _Her parents are no longer with us, I'm afraid. We are all she has.<EOP>
Leo: I see_

[caption #3232]
Leo: Don't worry, we won't let those monsters touch you ever again.

[caption #3233]
Kefka: Now, give her here.
She is_ quite precious.<EOP>
We'll be sure to take good care of her.

[caption #3234]
I didn't understand it at the time, but that [monster] in the capsule was likely_ <E$0C><OP$12>

[caption #3235]
Leo: So you have heard the rumors as well_

[caption #3236]
<A6>: It's not just a rumor. Hearing Kefka's plan for Doma is what turned me against the Empire in the first place.<EOP>
I traveled with the last survivor of Doma.
He lost his entire family_

[caption #3237]
Leo: __I still wish to wait for the formal investigation to complete.<EOP>
Just because I can imagine Kefka doing something so heinous does not give me the right to rush to judgment.<EOP>
<A6>: And if the investigation finds it to be true?
Then what?

[caption #3238]
No... because if what you say is true_<EOP>
Then it is precisely BECAUSE I left my post that such atrocities were able to happen.<EOP>
Kefka has become even more brazen in the power vacuum you left behind, corrupting the national conscience.<EOP>
The more power he gains, the more others with dark impulses feel enabled to act upon them.

[caption #3239]
Which is why it is even more imperative that I remain here and hold a firm line.<EOP>
I must maintain the Emperor's favor_<EOP>
if I am to remain in a position where I can most effectively protect our people from Kefka's influence.

[caption #3240]
Leo: _Then I will trust our justice system to deal with Kefka appropriately.<EOP>
<A6>: The same justice system that was going to have me executed without a trial for whistleblowing about this?<EOP>
Leo: __!

[caption #3241]
<A6>: _General, the Empire is corrupt, and I wish you could see that, too.<EOP>
Leo: I agree that Kefka is corrupt.
But Kefka is not the Empire.<EOP>
I will not turn against my people solely because of the actions of one man.

[caption #3242]
Mog: Good to see you again, kupo!<EOP>
Need my help, kupo?
<C> Welcome to the team, buddy!
<C> No, you'd better stay here

[caption #3243]
Your team already looks pretty crowded, kupo.
I may be small, but I don't think I'll fit, kupo!

[caption #3244]
You can count on me, kupo!
But remember I'll run right back home as soon as you don't need me, kupo!

Enemy attack?!

Where did they come from?!
Why are they attacking us now?!

[caption #3255]
Esper: Our friends_ our families_<EOP>
You took them all from us_!<EOP>
Leo: __!!

[caption #3256]
I_ I'm sorry_
I have no excuse_<EOP>
But attacking these civilians won't change what happened!<EOP>
If you are angry, I fully accept that anger, but leave these people out of it!

[caption #3257]
<A6>: They're gone__

[caption #3258]
Leo: Please go tend to the wounded_<EOP>
I think_ <D>it's finally time we had a word with the Emperor__

[caption #3259]
Cure_

[caption #3260]
Leo: General <A6>, your insinuations could lead to civil war. I will not subject our people to such internal strife!<EOP>
<A6>: But if the Empire keeps making enemies, sooner or later the war will come to us either way!

[caption #3261]
General <A6>, I believe your skills will prove necessary.<EOP>
Will you fight alongside me to protect our country's people?

[caption #3262]
Those monsters burned down my shop!<EOP>
I was able to salvage these, though.
Can I interest you in any?

[caption #3263]
Leo: Your assistance is appreciated, but please evacuate!

[caption #3264]
No, we cannot retreat!
Our people are still in danger!

[caption #3265]
<A0>: Working with the Empire to go after Espers_
I don't know_

[caption #3266]
<A0>: _ I was responsible for releasing those Espers from the Sealed Gate.<EOP>
What they've done after being released is my responsibility, too.

[caption #3267]
I do want to talk to them, but_ <D>I still feel hesitant_

[caption #3268]
<A0>_

[caption #3269]
<A1>: You have every right to be wary. That's why I'm coming with you.

[caption #3270]
<A1>: What do we know about this General Leo guy? Can we trust him?

[caption #3271]
<A0>: I feel like we might have met before, but_ it's fuzzy_

[caption #3272]
<A5>: I saw him at the camp at Doma. He seemed like a decent guy. For an Imperial.<EOP>
But he was still there to wage war.

[caption #3273]
<A2>: Aye, General Leo's forces laid siege to our castle for three years. He is not without sin.

[caption #3274]
And yet_ he always gave ample warning so that we could move the civilians to safety.<EOP>
He never blocked supply lines in an attempt to starve us out.<EOP>
He was relentless_ but also honorable.
He was an enemy, but had my respect.<EOP>
I suppose that is why the poisoning came as such a shock. General Leo would never resort to such a tactic_

[caption #3275]
<A1>: And I don't want to fall into that kind of false sense of security.<EOP>
Be careful, everyone.

[caption #3276]
<A0>: <A3>_ isn't he the bad person you said we should stay away from in South Figaro?

[caption #3277]
<A1>: Oh, right, you missed a lot while you were asleep in Zozo.<EOP>
Things happened_ <D>and our beliefs in who can be trusted may have changed_

[caption #3278]
Leo: Yes, Emperor Gestahl has recognized for himself the folly of this war,<EOP>
though I regret that it took so many lives being lost for him to do so_<EOP>
Kefka is being punished for his crimes and together we can undo his influence.
Justice will prevail.

[caption #3279]
Leo: <A0>, if you still want to talk, I'd be happy to lend an ear.

[caption #3280]
Kefka: Oh?
My, my, look who else decided to join the party.

[caption #3281]
That's it, my dear, you know where you belong.
Time to come home to Papa.

[caption #3282]
When the Emperor said to collect Magicite from all the Espers, he didn't mention [half] Espers_

[caption #3283]
You were such a fun plaything_
<D>but I'm also so, SO curious just what kind of Magicite you'd turn into_

[caption #3284]
No! You're not allowed to resist that!
You belong to ME!

[caption #3285]

   Whaaaaaaaat?!!!

[caption #3286]
<A0>: General Leo, I_ um_

[caption #3287]
<A0>_ I let him hurt you again_

[caption #3288]
This alliance was made in good faith!
I wholeheartedly denounce these actions!

[caption #3289]
General <A6>, you were right to be skeptical.
I should have listened to you.

[caption #3290]
Hang in there, soldier!

[caption #3291]
Even young children_
Such cruelty_

[caption #3292]
Elderly civilians_
Is there no one spared from this madness?

[caption #3293]
Oh, stop it, you're no different from that codependent suck-up of a general.<EOP>
You act all righteous, but in the end the only thing you know how to do_

[caption #3294]
_is what you're told.<EOP>
Now come HERE.

[caption #3295]
Well, well, what have we here now?

[caption #3296]
Grr, what reason do you even have to keep on living?

[caption #3297]
Look at that idiot general. Nothing he did mattered in the end.<EOP>
Is that what you want?

[caption #3298]
At least as Magicite you'll still be of some use to someone.

[caption #3299]
<A6>: Oh, you're awake!
How are you feeling?

[caption #3300]
<A0>: Everything is a blur_
I remember Kefka attacked us_
<D>He killed the Espers_ <D>
He hurt General Leo_<EOP>
I felt a surge of energy and emotion at the time.
I'd never felt so driven to act before.

[caption #3301]
What happened to General Leo?
Is he_?

[caption #3302]
<A1>: He's injured, but recovering.

[caption #3303]
<A0>: General Leo_?
Are you all right?

[caption #3304]
<A6>: General, what's the matter?!
It's just <A0>!

[caption #3305]
Leo: <A0>__? <D>
Is that the real <A0>?

[caption #3306]
Leo: I apologize.
It's just that Kefka toyed with my emotions to catch me off guard_<EOP>
It was shameless, even for him.

[caption #3307]
But then_ <D>when I thought I was sure to die, a figure wrapped in gentle light guided me back_

[caption #3308]
<A1>: You can thank <A0> for that! Looks like she's unlocked the power to return someone from the brink of death!

[caption #3309]
<A0>: _I'm sorry, <A1>. I don't think I can will that power back on my own_

[caption #3310]
<A1>: Oh_ <D>__ <D>
Wait, <A6>!
I didn't mean_!

[caption #3311]
Leo: So you_ saved me?
Even though I_

[caption #3312]
<A0>: Everyone was hurt_ I had no one to turn to for help.<EOP>
All I knew was that I didn't want to lose anyone else.

[caption #3313]
I'm used to conversations always turning to magic, or the war, or Espers, and my feelings getting left behind.

[caption #3314]
But not with you_<EOP>
You made my feelings a priority instead of something I needed to overcome to do you a favor.


[caption #3315]
I felt_ confused. I didn't know what to say to you back then.<EOP>
But I wanted to spend more time with you and talk to you more so that I could figure it out.<EOP>
So when I thought I might lose you__

[caption #3316]
But now I realize I was just doing the same_
Helping you because I wanted something from you_

[caption #3317]
Leo: <A0>_ There is nothing wrong with having expectations of someone's behavior.<EOP>
Certainly you have every reason to be left wanting due to mine_

[caption #3318]
However, you are also correct that your relationships with others should not be solely transactional.<EOP>
Recognizing this for yourself shows that your emotions are more developed than you realize.

[caption #3319]
I do not know if I deserved to have my life saved by you__<EOP>
But if your emotions felt that I should live, I do not wish to invalidate them.<EOP>
So you have my gratitude.

[caption #3320]
<A0>: General_

[caption #3321]
Leo: And yet_ <D>I cannot grant your wish.<EOP>
Even though you saved me with the hope I would help you in return_ and I truly wish I could_

[caption #3322]
Kefka's brazen actions have put my country, my people, and likely the world in danger.<EOP>
I love my people and must do what I can to protect them.

[caption #3323]
_Even if that means I can't be there for you right now.<EOP>
Please understand_

[caption #3324]
<A0>, you're stronger than you think. Recognize your capabilities and offer them where you see a need.<EOP>
This, I believe, will help you come to understand for yourself what [love] truly means.

[caption #3325]
Leo: We gather here to pay our respects to the Espers whose lives were lost here on this tragic day.<EOP>
We were on the precipice of peace, only to have it so callously demolished.<EOP>
We must honor their lives by ensuring their powers are not used for destructive purposes.

[caption #3326]
Leo: I apologize for the abruptness, but I must confront Kefka and Emperor Gestahl before it's too late.<EOP>
<A6>: But alone?
That's too dangerous! Kefka already tried to kill you once!<EOP>
Leo: I understand that, but_

[caption #3327]
I can't bear to see any more lives destroyed because of my inaction_

[caption #3328]
<A1>: Is it really okay to let him go like that?

[caption #3329]
<A0>: He has people who he would do anything to protect.<EOP>
I think_ <D>that's an act of [love].
<D>And if it is, we have no right to stop him.

[caption #3330]
<A0>: Is it really such a simple thing, though_? <D>To give up on something you love?

[caption #3331]
<A1>: What about Master Banon? Did the other Returners make it out all right?

[caption #3332]
<A4>: _ I don't know. We didn't have time to find him before we made our escape.<EOP>
There may still be clues to his fate back in Vector.

[caption #3333]
What about you? Did you find the Espers? Was General Leo true to his word?

[caption #3334]
This place looks deserted. I don't see any sign of the Returners or the Imperials anywhere.

[caption #3335]
Huh? Is that Interceptor?<EOP>
<A3> went on the mission to Thamasa, so what's he doing back in Vector?

[caption #3336]
Banon: Who's there?!

[caption #3337]
_ It's you! You're safe! Thank goodness!

[caption #3338]
[Banon! Arvis! We were sure you were goners after the Empire betrayed us!]<EOP>
Arvis: It was a close call, but we had help getting away.

[caption #3339]
[<A3>! You came back to sneak them to safety?]<EOP>
[Did General Leo send you?]

[caption #3340]
<A6>: _ No, I did.

[caption #3341]
<A6>: General Leo still had faith in the Emperor right up until Kefka's betrayal.<EOP>
But I've seen the underhanded way the Empire operates. I had my doubts about the mission from the start.

[caption #3342]
I told <A3> to come up with an excuse to leave and return to Vector to evacuate the Returners.

[caption #3343]
<A3>: It didn't take much to convince me to leave that place.

[caption #3344]
[Thank you, <A6>! We knew we could trust you!]

[caption #3345]
<A1>: <A6>_ <D>I'm sorry I ever doubted you.

[caption #3346]
<A6>: But now the Emperor has his hands on the Warring Triad.<EOP>
We need to stop him before he unleashes an even more devastating power.<EOP>
Will you help us?

[caption #3347]
Banon: The Returners are scattered and disorganized right now. I'm afraid we won't be of much help.

[caption #3348]
<A6>: <A3>, will you help us?

[caption #3349]
<A3>: If the pay is right, I'll do whatever you want.<EOP>
Besides, General Leo still owes me money for the Crescent Island job.

[caption #3350]
But you didn't do anything_

[caption #3351]
Right, then let's find that Floating Continent and stop Emperor Gestahl and Kefka!

[caption #3352]
Leo: Ugh_ I can't believe the Emperor would go this far_<EOP>
I must reach him before he causes any further damage!

[caption #3353]
<A0>! General <A6>!
What are you doing here?!

[caption #3354]
<A6>: The same thing as you!
We came to stop Kefka and the Emperor!

[caption #3355]
<A0>: It was my decision to come here this time. No one had to ask me.

[caption #3356]
Leo: I see_ <D>But I fear I would lose my leverage with the Emperor if I came to him in league with enemy forces.

[caption #3357]
He says he relies on my trustworthiness. It is a reason he would favor me over Kefka.

[caption #3358]
<A0>: So_ shunning us would be the most honest expression of your feelings?<EOP>
Leo: _!!

[caption #3359]
Leo: No, perhaps you are right.<EOP>
The Emperor likely desires this power in order to defeat some perceived [enemy].

[caption #3360]
But if we come to him together and show him there is no [enemy], he may reconsider.<EOP>
Shall we go to him as comrades in arms?

[caption #3361]
Leo: Welcome back.
Come, let us face the Emperor together.

[caption #3362]
Leo: I refuse to leave until I have confronted Emperor Gestahl and Kefka.<EOP>
However, I recognize your right to an audience with him and will await your return before proceeding.

[caption #3363]
Gestahl: Well well_ it would appear that Kefka's report of your betrayal was accurate, General Leo.<EOP>
A pity.
You were always so reliable.

[caption #3364]
Leo: My liege, I have always acted for the good of our nation and I still do!

[caption #3365]
But this_ 
these statues_ 
this floating island_<EOP>
I cannot see how this would be of benefit to our people.

[caption #3366]
Gestahl: Ah, yes, this marvelous power_<EOP>
Of course someone like you who rejected magic would never understand.

[caption #3367]
<A6>: In that case, I also object to this.
Please, Emperor, stop this madness!
Gestahl: Hmph!

[caption #3368]
Leo: Please, your majesty, you have always been able to depend on me, so I beg you to trust my judgment!

[caption #3369]
Gestahl: Yes, certainly you were trustworthy, Leo. A far cry more than Kefka.<EOP>
Leo: Thank you, my liege!

[caption #3370]
Gestahl: Can you imagine South Figaro capitulating to anyone else?
We subjugated them easily!<EOP>
Leo: Well, yes, the objective was to minimize casualties__

[caption #3371]
Gestahl: Doma might have checked for poison if they were against any other foe.
Leo: __!!

[caption #3372]
Gestahl: And I knew that you were the only one who could coax those Espers out for the harvest.

[caption #3373]
All the while people from those conquered towns eagerly sacrificed their lives for me because they believed in you!

[caption #3374]
I depended on your ability to pacify them and leave them vulnerable!<EOP>
Certainly Kefka could never accomplish that! No one trusts him, and for good reason!
He'll backstab you in an instant!

[caption #3375]
But I no longer require the consent of the masses to rule. They will bow before this power!

[caption #3376]
And therefore your skills are no longer necessary.

[caption #3377]
<A0>: General Leo!

[caption #3378]
He's_ <D>he's hurting.
His heart is in so much pain_

[caption #3379]
Kefka: Gya ha ha!
Oh, please! As if the emotionless puppet knows anything about [feelings]!

[caption #3380]
<A0>: That was_ <D>because of you_
Gestahl: Hm?

[caption #3381]
<A0>: You_ STOLE my feelings from me.

[caption #3382]
But I've laughed alongside my friends_ <D>
I've mourned alongside them, too_

[caption #3383]
But when I see what makes YOU laugh, I realize that I'M not the one who doesn't understand emotions!<EOP>
Gestahl: Grr, hold your tongue, insolent girl!

[caption #3384]
Leo: I refuse to be a mere bystander to calamity any further!

[caption #3385]
Kefka!
You shall cause the people of this world no further harm!

[caption #3386]
Leo: Go! The world can't afford to lose anyone who cherishes its protection!

[caption #3387]
Leo: <A0>_ General <A6>_
I'm sorry I never helped you before.
This is all I can do now_<EOP>
I'll follow after you if I can, but you must escape!<EOP>
Kefka: You're not going anywhere!

[caption #3388]
Leo: Death is a coward's way out of responsibility!
Let's get out of here!

[caption #3389]
<A0>: Wh_ what happened? <D>
Where am I_?

[caption #3390]
<A1>? <D>
<A6>?

[caption #3391]
<A4>? <D>
<A5>?

[caption #3392]
General Leo_?

[caption #3393]
____ Anyone?

[caption #3394]
Wh_ what was that light just now?<EOP>
A beam piercing through the sky towards the east_

[caption #3395]
<A0>: What happened here_?
Everything's demolished__

[caption #3396]
*sniff* <D>
*sniff*

[caption #3397]
<A0>: Huh? Is someone crying?

[caption #3398]
Child: Mama__

[caption #3399]
<A0>: Huh? Where's your Mama?

[caption #3400]
<A0>: Oh__

[caption #3401]
Come on, it's not safe out here!
There's monsters around.

[caption #3402]
Duane: Who's there?!

[caption #3403]
<A0>: More people! 
So there were other survivors!<EOP>
__ <D>But you're all so young.
Where are your parents?

[caption #3404]
Duane: They're gone.

[caption #3405]
<A0>: Oh no_
Has Kefka really become that powerful?

[caption #3406]
I've been separated from my friends.
Has anyone else from the outside come here?

[caption #3407]
Katarin: Well, there is that person in the other house, but__ <EOP>
<A0>: Another person?!

[caption #3408]
Could it be one of my friends?

[caption #3409]
Katarin: Wait!

[caption #3410]
He's_ <D>dead_

[caption #3411]
But at least it wasn't one of my friends_

[caption #3412]
What am I saying? He was still a person.<EOP>
Someone_ <D>must have loved him.
<D>Someone's going to be sad that he's gone.

[caption #3413]
I need to find my friends. I might still be able to help them.

[caption #3414]
Child: Duane, I'm cold.

[caption #3415]
I'm hungry.

[caption #3416]
My tummy hurts.

[caption #3417]
Katarin: I can hear monsters prowling outside_

[caption #3418]
<A0>: I_ can light a fire. <D>
And heal. <D>
And fight monsters.<EOP>
Food, though_

[caption #3419]
Duane: Most of the monsters in the area are poisonous, and the crops were destroyed by rats.<EOP>
Those rats are probably the only thing left that can be eaten anymore_


[caption #3420]
Duane: I know, I know, but we don't have any food or medicine or anything to light a fire.

[caption #3421]
I'm sorry I couldn't help you__

[caption #3422]
Katarin: I think we're going to make it!
Thank you so much, <A0>!

[caption #3423]
Katarin: The children are smiling again thanks to you!

[caption #3424]
Katarin: The food stock is looking good but we could use a bit more.

[caption #3425]
Katarin: Things are improving, I think.

[caption #3426]
Katarin: We're doing a little better.  Thank you.

[caption #3427]
Katarin: Not much has improved, I don't think.

[caption #3428]
Katarin: Things are still getting worse.

[caption #3429]
Katarin: There's barely any food left.

[caption #3430]
Katarin: We're out of food. The children are getting weak and scared.

[caption #3431]
Katarin: <A0>, while you were out, one of the children, he_<EOP>
<A0>: What_?

[caption #3432]
Katarin: The rats have infested the fields at the north of town.
Please kill any you see.<EOP>
Some of them may be edible. Bring back the meat for our food stores.<EOP>
Duane has set up a shelter for the children in the basement. They're all right for now.<EOP>
Please focus on clearing the field of rats and bringing back food. I'll let you know if Duane needs help.<EOP>
Thank you, and good luck.

[caption #3433]
The fire in the basement has gone out. Could you please re-light it?

[caption #3434]
One of the children is sick. Can you heal him?

[caption #3435]
The fire in the basement is still out. It's gotten so cold and we can't cook anything_

[caption #3436]
The sick child's condition has gotten worse. Please, help him!

[caption #3437]
Thank you for re-lighting the fire. It's the only warmth we have.

[caption #3438]
Thank you for healing the child. He's doing much better now.

[caption #3439]
You brought some meat! Thank you!

[caption #3440]
You got some rat meat.
<C> Keep it.
<C> Throw it out.

[caption #3441]
Fire!

[caption #3442]
Cure!

[caption #3443]
<A0>: How are things going?

[caption #3444]
The rats are in the garden again.
Please drive them out and bring back anything we could eat.

[caption #3445]
Thanks, I'm feeling better now!

[caption #3446]
I gotta be strong for everyone!

[caption #3447]
When are Mama and Papa coming back?

[caption #3448]
I wanna go outside!

[caption #3449]
I'm hungry_

[caption #3450]
I don't like it down here. It's cold and dark and smells funny.

[caption #3451]
__I'm scared_

[caption #3452]
Duane: I feel so useless_

[caption #3453]
Katarin: Thank you for helping us. Good luck.

[caption #3454]
Katarin: Thank you for getting rid of all the rats.

[caption #3455]
<A0>: I couldn't save him, even though I worked so hard_

[caption #3456]
Why_ am I so upset?<D>
I didn't even know him.

[caption #3457]
My friends could be suffering or dying just like this, and I haven't even gone to look for them.<EOP>
Do I just not care?

[caption #3458]
My friends_ <D>or these children.<EOP>
I'm so conflicted_

[caption #3459]
Duane: It's Humbaba!<EOP>
Our parents told stories of a fearsome monster sealed under the earth centuries ago.<EOP>
When the world was ripped apart, it must have been released!

[caption #3460]
Katarin: You mean that legendary child-eating demon?!
<A0>: !!

[caption #3461]
<A0>: No! I have to do something!

[caption #3462]
<A0>: I won't let you eat anyone in this village!

[caption #3463]
<A0>: It ran_ <D>But it will be back, I'm sure.

[caption #3464]
<A6>_ <D><A1>_ <D><A4>_ <D>General Leo_<EOP>
Something inside me is telling me I need to stay here.<EOP>
I don't understand it, but_ <D>
I hope you can forgive me_

[caption #3465]

           One year later_ <E$20><OP$12>

[caption #3466]
<A0>: I did it_ I helped them.
Even though I don't even know them.

[caption #3467]
<A0>: What is this feeling I have_?

[caption #3468]
I still haven't been able to search for my friends. They might be suffering. They might need my help, too.<EOP>
But_

[caption #3469]
<A0>: Is that_?!

[caption #3470]
<A0>: Hey! Hang in there!

[caption #3471]
<A0>: She looks exhausted. I should let her rest.

[caption #3472]
<A0>: Are you awake?

[caption #3473]
<A6>: <A0>_ <D>is it really you?

[caption #3474]
<A0>: I'm so happy to see you're alive!<EOP>
I haven't seen anyone else in a year, so I thought_

[caption #3475]
I thought no one else had survived_

[caption #3476]
<A6>: __<EOP>
I thought the same_
I do know that there are many who didn't make it.<EOP>
I thought_ <D>that I was all alone in the world_

[caption #3477]
<A6>: But I know for certain that <A1> must be alive!<EOP>
The rest of our friends must be, too!
Finding you is proof of that!<EOP>
Let's work together to find the rest of them!<EOP>
<A0>: I_

[caption #3478]
I can't_

[caption #3479]
<A6>: Why not?<EOP>
Kefka is going to continue to drive the world further into ruin if no one stands up to him!<EOP>
The longer we do nothing, the more people die!

[caption #3480]
<A0>: I know, but_

[caption #3481]
<A6>: You sound like General Leo.<EOP>
<A0>: Huh_?

[caption #3482]
<A6>: Always playing it safe. Worrying about what would happen to his troops if he took too big a risk.<EOP>
Like questioning Gestahl_ <D>
Or standing up to Kefka.

[caption #3483]
<A6>: I suppose I have the luxury of not having anyone important to me left_
<A0>: __

[caption #3484]
<A6>: But so long as you're not confronting the source of these people's misery, are you really [saving] anyone?

[caption #3485]
Katarin: I'm sorry, <A0>.
You finally found one of your friends.<EOP>
But I feel like we drove her away_<EOP>
Duane: If only I was more responsible! You're the one who's had to bear all our burdens!

[caption #3486]


[caption #3487]
<A0>: No! Don't apologize!
You've never been a burden to me!

[caption #3488]
But <A6>__ <D>
My friends__

[caption #3489]
Waaaah!
Humbaba's back!

[caption #3490]
<A0>: Oh no!
And <A6> only just recovered!<EOP>
If that monster gets her because of me__!

[caption #3491]
Katarin: It's really starting to show now. I hope the food stores can handle an extra mouth to feed.

[caption #3492]
Duane: I killed two rats yesterday!
I'll make sure everyone stays fed!

[caption #3493]
How come Katarin's been getting more food than us?

[caption #3494]
Tell us another story, Mama!

[caption #3495]
The dogs are really loud today.

[caption #3496]
My clothes are getting too small.
And Katarin's growing out of hers, too!

[caption #3497]
I'm gonna be an expert rat-hunter like Mama!

[caption #3498]
I see Katarin act sick sometimes.
Can you not heal her?

[caption #3499]
The dogs are barking_
Is that monster back?

[caption #3500]
<A0>: She's alive_ <D>
<A6> is alive_

[caption #3501]
My chest is aching so much.<EOP>
But is this happiness_ <D>
or guilt?

[caption #3502]
I wonder what happened to her. I'm afraid to ask.<EOP>
But for now, I should let her recover.

[caption #3503]
Katarin: That woman_ is she a friend of yours?

[caption #3504]
Katarin: I'm so happy you finally found one of your friends you've talked about.<EOP>
But_ <D>I'm also worried that means you'll leave us.<EOP>
With the baby on the way, I don't know how we'd manage.

[caption #3505]
Duane: Hey, maybe her friend will stay to help out instead!

[caption #3506]
Katarin: Oh, yes, you should ask her to stay!
It would take some burden off you, too, I'm sure!

[caption #3507]
Katarin: I don't know what we would do without you.

[caption #3508]
Duane: If I'm gonna be a father, I really should be stepping up more.

[caption #3509]
Is that pretty lady really your friend, Mama?

[caption #3510]
That lady came from the water!
Is she a kappa?

[caption #3511]
Wow, a new person!

[caption #3512]
Are we getting another Mama?

[caption #3513]
Did that lady get attacked by monsters?

[caption #3514]
Does this mean our parents are going to come back out of the water, too?

[caption #3515]
I hope that lady doesn't die_

[caption #3516]
<A6>: You sure you're okay leaving them?

[caption #3517]
<A0>: With Humbaba gone, they should be safe for now.<EOP>
And Duane's gotten really good at killing rats!

[caption #3518]
<A0>: You said you were sure <A1>'s alive.<EOP>
Have you seen him? Do you know where he is?

[caption #3519]
<A6>: No_ <D>I haven't been able to do any searching yet, either.

[caption #3520]
<A6>: But I did find this. It's enough to keep me going.

[caption #3521]
<A0>: A year ago, Mobliz was the only place I could reach.<EOP>
I never saw any other people or anywhere else to go.

[caption #3522]
<A6>: Things may have changed since then.
Together, I'm sure we'll find someone!

[caption #3523]
<A0>: A town! So there WERE other survivors!<EOP>
<A6>: Let's ask if anyone has seen our friends!

[caption #3524]
Gerad: A lesser man might become distracted by the attention from TWO lovely ladies.

[caption #3525]
<A6>: You're right, I guess <A4> IS a lesser man than you.

[caption #3526]
Gerad: N_ now hold on there! Let's not go disrespecting the king!<EOP>
He may be a bane to us thieves, but even we can't ignore how charming he is.<EOP>
And handsome.<EOP>
And smart.<EOP>
And funny.<EOP>
And generous.<EOP>
And humble.<EOP>
Really, it's no wonder he can't keep the ladies off his back!

[caption #3527]
Wh_ wherever he is right now, that is.
I am sure he is simply awash in the attentions of women.

[caption #3528]
<A6>: I know it's been a year, but that's definitely <A4> in a different outfit, right?<EOP>
<A0>: Maybe someone's controlling him!

[caption #3529]
<A0>: Or maybe he's having some kind of post-traumatic identity crisis_
<A6>: __

[caption #3530]
<A6>: Whatever it is, he's the only lead we have right now. Let's follow him.

[caption #3531]
Chancellor: Everything seems to be back in order, Your Majesty! It feels good to be back in the fresh air!

[caption #3532]
<A0>: You were all trapped down there for a year, slowly suffocating_ it must have been awful_<EOP>
Chancellor: We had faith that King <A4> would come through for us!<EOP>
He may love chasing women, but he loves his kingdom more!

[caption #3533]
<A0>: Love_?

[caption #3534]
<A4>: It's in times of crisis that people naturally cling to what's most important to them.<EOP>
When I learned about what happened to Figaro, finding a way to save it was the only thing on my mind.

[caption #3535]
Sorry I was so distant with you two before, but Figaro came first.<EOP>
<A0>: It's all right. I think I understand how you felt.

[caption #3536]
<A4>: You do?!
Have your feelings undergone some maturing this past year, then?<EOP>
<A0>: Not_ about you, no_

[caption #3537]
<A4>: What's this? The ice-cold general laughs?<EOP>
<A6>: Only at your ineptitude.

[caption #3538]
<A4>: I know, I know.

[caption #3539]
You prefer the [rogue-ish] type, right?

[caption #3540]
<A4>: Unfortunately, it will be some time yet before my more impressive capabilites are back at full function.<EOP>
With everything that happened, my usual network of informants has been disrupted.<EOP>
Otherwise, I would have single-handedly found everyone else by now.

[caption #3541]
But! That doesn't mean I'm completely empty-handed. Port towns are great places to pick up rumors.

[caption #3542]
For example, most of the towns are on separate continents now.<EOP>
Even Kohlingen, which used to only be across the mountains, is now across the ocean.<EOP>
Our engineers are in the process of confirming whether or not the castle can still reach it.<EOP>
The splitting of the earth also released many long-dormant monsters.<EOP>
Such as the 8 legendary dragons, and the aerial menace, Deathgaze.

[caption #3543]
And, of course, the most conspicuous_

[caption #3544]
The day the world fell, the entire Imperial capital collapsed on itself like it was being crushed from within.<EOP>
A grotesque tower rose from its rubble, with Kefka seated at its summit.<EOP>
It rains down arbitrary [judgment] on the few towns that remain.

[caption #3545]
The tower is impenetrable from the ground. The only chance of breaching it and confronting Kefka is by air.

[caption #3546]
If only the Blackjack hadn't been destroyed_

[caption #3547]
<A6>: We should focus on finding our friends first before launching any kind of assault.

[caption #3548]
<A4>: But of course!<EOP>
I'm sure <A5> weathered the end of the world as if it were a light breeze!<EOP>
Not to mention I'd hate for him to miss the chance to wallop Kefka!

[caption #3549]
<A0>: I'm worried about everyone else, too_
I hope they're all right_

[caption #3550]
Sire! We have confirmed that the track to Kohlingen is still operational!<EOP>
<A4>: Excellent! Then let us depart as soon as we're ready!

[caption #3551]
Who goes there?!

[caption #3552]
Leo: <A0>?! You're_ <D>alive!

[caption #3553]
And General <A6>, too!

[caption #3554]
Leo: General <A6>?! You're alive!

[caption #3555]
<A0>! You both survived!

[caption #3556]
Leo: Sir <A2>! You survived! A testament to the resiliance of Doma!

[caption #3557]
Leo: King <A4>, I am pleased to see you are well. How fare the people of Figaro?

[caption #3558]
Leo: <A1>! Returners are resourceful as ever, I see!<EOP>
Are_ <D><A0> and General <A6> still accompanying you by any chance?

[caption #3559]
Leo: Ah, <A3>. Finally come to collect your payment, have you?

[caption #3560]
Leo: You are_ Prince <A5> of Figaro, are you not?

[caption #3561]
Leo: The old sage from Thamasa_
How are you holding up, sir?

[caption #3562]
Leo: I believe I met you in Thamasa, didn't I?
How is your grandfather?

[caption #3563]
Leo: The wandering gambler_
Are you here to procure yourself a new ship?<EOP>
Apoligies, but this one doesn't fly. It barely even floats.

[caption #3564]
Leo: Oh_ <D>dear, you poor boy.
Let me see if I have some food for you.

[caption #3565]
Leo: Um_ <D>why is there a yeti on my ship?

[caption #3566]
Leo: What_?

[caption #3567]
Leo: <A0>! General <A6>!<EOP>
You're_ <D>you're both alive!


[caption #3568]
I searched for both of you to no avail.<EOP>
After Kefka's purge, I thought everyone from the Empire was_

[caption #3569]
<A0>: I've been worried about what happened to you ever since the airship broke apart.

[caption #3570]
<A0>: You never came back when we escaped the Floating Continent.
I was afraid you'd_

[caption #3571]
Leo: I told you before: Your emotions willed that I live.
I still want to respect that.

[caption #3572]
Even though it's been hard sometimes_

[caption #3573]
Vector, the Empire, my home, my people_<EOP>
They're all gone.
Everyone and everything I'd been working to protect_<EOP>
__ Or, I thought I was protecting them. <EOP>
Emperor Gestahl had convinced us that the actions we took were necessary to protect our people.<EOP>
But that was all a lie.
He was simply exploiting our emotions to serve his own ends.

[caption #3574]
Now I don't know what to believe anymore.
I have no anchor_so I've just been drifting.<EOP>
Picking up wayward people and supplies and dropping them off elsewhere.

[caption #3575]
<A6>: We're gathering our friends to go stop Kefka once and for all.
You should come with us!

[caption #3576]
Leo: __No.
It's my fault Kefka was never stopped before this.
And now it's too late_<EOP>
Provoking him would only cause him to lash out further. These people have suffered enough.

[caption #3577]
I'm sorry.
I'm grateful you're alive, but there's nothing I can do to help you.

[caption #3578]
<A6>: You've been running supplies to towns that were cut off after the collapse of the world, right?

[caption #3579]
Leo: That's right.
I can't fight Kefka, but I also can't sit back and watch people suffer because of him.

[caption #3580]
<A6>: <A0>'s spent the last year in a remote town looking after orphans.<EOP>
They've been eating rats and living in an underground bunker.

[caption #3581]
Leo: Wh_what?!

[caption #3582]
<A6>: And one of them is about to have a baby, and they have no decent food or clothes or toys, or_

[caption #3583]
Aaaaaah!

[caption #3584]
<A0>: <A6>, you're right! Oh, I should have been picking things up for them!<EOP>
I can't let that baby be born in such miserable conditions!

[caption #3585]
Leo: Wh_whatever you need, you have use of this ship to transport it!<EOP>
<A0>: Really?! Thank you so much!

[caption #3586]
I can provide a few things, but you won't find commodities like food, children's clothing, and toys in shops.<EOP>
When the townspeople awaken in the morning, you'll have to ask them if they'd be willing to part with them.<EOP>
Hopefully you have things to trade, because such items are worth more than money in this world.

[caption #3587]
I'll stay here and get the ship ready. Come back to me when you've collected everything you need.

[caption #3588]
Now if only I can muster the courage to go out there_

[caption #3589]
I learned from reading these monster books that monsters out there will petrify you.<EOP>
If you give me a [Jewel Ring] relic, I'll let you read about it yourself.

[caption #3590]
Exchange [Jewel Ring] for [Monster Tome]?
<C> Yes
<C> No

[caption #3591]
Thanks! Now I can try to brave the world out there as squishy flesh!

[caption #3592]
Hey, don't try to pull a fast one on me! I'm not giving you this book without a [Jewel Ring]!

[caption #3593]
Nyererererer_ <D>I just shocked myself_

[caption #3594]
Fishing is just too tedious. I'll bet if I had a [ThunderBlade] I could just zap them out of the water!<EOP>
Then I wouldn't need this fishing line anymore.

[caption #3595]
Exchange [ThunderBlade] for [Fishing Line]?
<C> Yes
<C> No

[caption #3596]
All right! Those fish are in for quite a shock!

[caption #3597]
None of your swords pack the right [jolt].
Come back when you have a [Thunderblade].

[caption #3598]
I'ma_cast a fireball_ <D>hic_

[caption #3599]
The world's gone to hell and all you can do about it is drink. Gonna need somethin' stiffer than this.<EOP>
If you've got something like [Ether] to help me forget my woes, I'll share a glass with you.

[caption #3600]
Exchange [Ether] for [Wine Glass]?
<C> Yes
<C> No

[caption #3601]
Ahh, thanks.
Time to restore some of that vigor_

[caption #3602]
No free drinks, and none of that weak stuff! Gimme an [Ether] or get out!

[caption #3603]
I just hope my son doesn't decide he wants to fight monsters, too_

[caption #3604]
My son stopped playing with his toys and only wants to read about monsters now.<EOP>
I suppose reading is good for him, but I don't have very many books about monsters.

[caption #3605]
Give [Monster Tome]?
<C> Yes
<C> No

[caption #3606]
Oh my goodness, thank you!<EOP>
If you want, you can have these toys, since my son isn't using them anymore.

[caption #3607]

     Received [Toy Box]!

[caption #3608]
Don't worry_I'll see you both soon_

[caption #3609]
My wife was pregnant a year ago, but then the world fell and_<EOP>
We even had clothes picked out, but never got to use them.<EOP>
Now all I can do is drink away my sorrows, but I look like a deadbeat chugging straight from a bottle_

[caption #3610]
Give [Wine Glass]?
<C> Yes
<C> No

[caption #3611]
With this, at least I can waste away looking more civilized.<EOP>
If you have any use for these baby clothes, please take them.

[caption #3612]

     Received [Baby Clothes]!

[caption #3613]
Wait, why are all the fish electrocuted?

[caption #3614]
I've got this box of rations the Imperial troops left behind, but I've got no taste for Imperial food.<EOP>
We can be self-sufficient without the Empire! I can get my own food!<EOP>
Now if only I had a fishing line_

[caption #3615]
Give [Fishing Line]?
<C> Yes
<C> No

[caption #3616]
Perfect!
[Teach a man to fish and he'll eat for a lifetime], am I right?<EOP>
Take as much of that [freeloader] food as you want.

[caption #3617]

     Received [Rations]!

[caption #3618]
I found this green stone outside, and after messing with it for a while I suddenly warped myself back to town.<EOP>
That was too weird. I'd rather just use a Warp Stone like a normal person.


[caption #3619]
Exchange [Warp Stone] for [mysterious green stone]?
<C> Yes
<C> No

[caption #3620]
Thanks! Here, see if it's of any use to you. Later!

[caption #3621]
Don't try to pass off a plain old rock as a Warp Stone!

[caption #3622]

     Received the Magicite
              [Fenrir]

[caption #3623]
Leo: You're looking for food, clothes, and toys, right?<EOP>
You won't find those items in shops, but some townspeople may trade for shop items. Try starting there.<EOP>
Let me know when you have everything.

[caption #3624]
Leo: Excellent, you've procured everything we need!
I have everything ready here, too.

[caption #3625]
Leo: So, where can I take you?<EOP>
<A0>: The children are in Mobliz.

[caption #3626]
Leo: M_Mobliz?!<EOP>
<A0>: Is something wrong?

[caption #3627]
Leo: N_no.
Just that we should get there with all haste.

[caption #3628]
A ship might have come in. Better check the dock.

[caption #3629]
Leo: A moogle has boarded my ship!
Is this a sign of good fortune?

[caption #3630]
I love the shampoo the ghost ship sometimes delivers. Makes my hair smell like freshly-washed chocobo.<EOP>
And no, you can't have any!

[caption #3631]
Huh! Ain't never seen the ghost ship stay 'til morning before!

[caption #3632]
The ghost ship stayed longer than usual. I get the feelin' it's gonna be gone for a while now_

[caption #3633]
So it was General Leo running the ghost ship!<EOP>
I should have known, that man has always been eager to be of service.

[caption #3634]

     Received [Monster Tome]!

[caption #3635]

     Received [Fishing Line]!

[caption #3636]

     Received [Wine Glass]!

[caption #3637]
Come, let's be off.

[caption #3638]
Leo: That town in the distance looks to be utterly annihilated_<EOP>
I think it's_ <D>Mobliz!<EOP>
Refugee: Should we go check for survivors?

[caption #3639]
Hey, there's someone in the water out there!

[caption #3640]
Leo: Hang in there!

[caption #3641]
You! Go check the supplies for phoenix down, elixir, anything!

[caption #3642]
Man: Unnhhh__<EOP>
Leo: Save your strength!
Were there any other survivors?<EOP>
Man: Light from the sky__ <D>
__horrible monster__<EOP>
Leo: Hey!<EOP>
____

[caption #3643]
Refugee: Sorry_we didn't have anything_

[caption #3644]
Are_we still gonna check for other survivors?<EOP>
He said there was a monster_

[caption #3645]
Leo: _No.<EOP>
This is a triage situation. If we have no healing items, I am not going to expose you to unnecessary danger.

[caption #3646]
This town_ <D>is likely a lost cause.<EOP>
But you all are still alive.
So I'm going to prioritize getting you someplace safe.<EOP>
Refugee: Phew_that's a relief.

[caption #3647]
Leo: I_ <D>abandoned you again_

[caption #3648]
<A0>: Having trouble sleeping?

[caption #3649]
Leo: !!
<A0>! Is everything all right?

[caption #3650]
<A0>: I was thinking about how we got you to come along with us_<EOP>
and I wanted to make sure you really were okay with it.<EOP>
Leo: ?? Why would I not be?

[caption #3651]
<A0>: You said [no], but then we manipulated your emotions to get you to do what we wanted, anyway.<EOP>
_Just like how Gestahl controlled you_<EOP>
Leo: !!

[caption #3652]
Leo: No, no, I only refused to fight Kefka.<EOP>
Helping you_ <D>helping vulnerable people_<EOP>
That's different.

[caption #3653]
__Or maybe I'm just telling myself that to justify my own cowardice.

[caption #3654]
<A0>: You know_ <D>when <A6> first came to me and asked me to fight Kefka_<EOP>
I said [no], too_

[caption #3655]
I had people who were important to me_I didn't want to leave them and risk their safety.

[caption #3656]
At the time I didn't know why I would feel that way.<EOP>
Kefka obviously needs to be stopped, right?
So why would I hesitate?

[caption #3657]
Why would I_ <D>just do nothing while I knew he was making other people suffer?

[caption #3658]
Leo: So_ <D>what ended up changing your resolve?

[caption #3659]
<A0>: I realized that to truly protect them, I had to confront the reason they needed protection in the first place.<EOP>
To slay that monster instead of hiding from it, to open up more possibilities for them.

[caption #3660]
Leo: You've really come into your own this past year.

[caption #3661]
<A0>: Well_that's because I think I finally understand what you had been trying to say.

[caption #3662]
Where is <A0>? These are her children we are helping, so it is only proper that she be here.

[caption #3663]
I know the airship is faster, but we should really have General Leo come along_

[caption #3664]
<A0>: I'm back! I hope everyone is still doing all right!

[caption #3665]
Yaay! Mama's home!

[caption #3666]
I was good and ate my rat every day!

[caption #3667]
<A0>: We brought back something better than rats this time!<EOP>
Food, new clothes, and toys!

[caption #3668]
Yaaaay!

[caption #3669]
<A0>: Could you help distribute some of these toys?<EOP>
Leo: Of course!

[caption #3670]
Yaay! Thank you for the toys!

[caption #3671]
And thanks for bringing our Mama home, too, Mister!<EOP>
Leo: !!

[caption #3672]
Leo: Y_ <D>you're welcome_

[caption #3673]
<A0>: It sounds like Duane's been taking good care of you.<EOP>
And with these extra supplies, you won't have to worry about the baby so much.<EOP>
Katarin: Thank you, <A0>_
I don't know what we would do without you_

[caption #3674]
<A0>: Huh? Did you see where General Leo went?

[caption #3675]
That guy with the mohawk who came with you?
He went outside a bit ago.

[caption #3676]
<A0>: There you are.<EOP>
Are you_ <D>all right_?

[caption #3677]
Leo: I_ <D>brought you home_

[caption #3678]
Like you, many of my own soldiers were people torn from their homes and forced to fight_

[caption #3679]
No one should be compelled to give their lives for someone else's cause_<EOP>
So I did what I could to keep them alive until I could send them home.<EOP>
But that meant playing it safe. Never taking decisive action.
The war dragged on_

[caption #3680]
And still I only sent them home in caskets_

[caption #3681]
All the while, I turned my back on you, who had already lost everything.

[caption #3682]
And yet_ <D>even after the world collapsed, you found yourself a new home, family, and purpose_<EOP>
And you did it all on your own.

[caption #3683]
I failed you before. But I absolutely want to protect what you have now.<EOP>
<A0>: General Leo_

[caption #3684]
Leo: There is no longer any need for you to call me [General].<EOP>
I do this not as a soldier_ <D>but as a human being.<EOP>
<A0>: Then, what would you like me to call you instead?

[caption #3685]
<A10>: _Just [<A10>] is sufficient.<EOP>
<A0>: All right_ <D><A10>.

[caption #3686]
<A10>: I was solely on the defensive with Kefka before, yet my people still died.<EOP>
If the world is to know peace, he must be stopped.<EOP>
Even if confronting him causes collateral damage, at this point it is still the lesser sacrifice.

[caption #3687]
<A0>_I know I have not been the ally I should have been,<EOP>
but would you allow me to fight by your side?<EOP>
<A0>: Of course!

[caption #3688]
<A10>: If we're going away again, we should at least leave the children with a memento.<EOP>
And I think I have just the thing_

[caption #3689]
<A10>: I couldn't confront Kefka before because I was afraid of what would happen to my people.<EOP>
If I was banished or executed, they would fall under Kefka's control.<EOP>
And if somehow I wasn't, he would still certainly have retaliated against them to get to me_

[caption #3690]
Like you, I felt trapped. I couldn't act out of fear for their safety_

[caption #3691]
I don't want you to be held back by the same reservations.<EOP>
I want you to be able to fight to your fullest knowing that no matter what,<EOP>
these children will be safe.

[caption #3692]
If you will permit me, I will stay here and protect them in your absence.<EOP>
<A0>: Are you sure_?

<A10>: Well_I'd always imagined that after I retired, I'd look after war orphans.<EOP>
It was my fault many of them lost their families to begin with.
It's the least I can do.

[caption #3694]
<A0>: Thank you_
It does put my heart more at ease.

[caption #3695]
<A10>: Oh! That reminds me of something_

[caption #3696]
<A10>: I picked this up quite some time ago, but could never bring myself to leave it with any supply drops.

<A0>: It's covered in little moogle figures!
I love it!<EOP>
__ <D>What is it?

[caption #3698]
<A10>: It's a music box. I had a similar one when I was little.<EOP>
The sound of it helped soothe my emotions when I was anxious.<EOP>
I was hoping it could help do the same for them.

[caption #3699]
<A0>: Music_ <D>can help you feel a certain way?

[caption #3700]
<A10>: Yes, that has been my experience.<EOP>
Joy, <D>sorrow, <D>excitement_<EOP>
There is music that complements every emotion.

You may have noticed numerous record players in your travels.<EOP>
Try visiting them and you can see what I mean.<EOP>
They may provide you with an extra boost of strength.

[caption #3702]
And_I, too need to accept strength wherever I can find it.

[caption #3703]
I rejected Magitek infusions because they were artificial, stolen power.<EOP>
One does not appreciate the gravity of power they didn't have to work for.<EOP>
They are prone to wielding it carelessly.

[caption #3704]
But you were born with your magic. It's a part of you and you understand its weight.<EOP>
If I am to utilize magic in this battle, you are the only one whom I can trust to teach me.<EOP>
<A0>: I would be honored.

[caption #3705]
Use that strength to reshape this world for the better.

[caption #3706]
Yeah! You go beat that bad man, Mama! Just like you beat Humbaba!

Mister <A10> will be our Papa while you're gone!

<A0>: I think your new title suits you.

<A10>: Then_I wish you well. Please be safe.<EOP>
We'll all be here waiting for you.

<A0>: The Espers we met on our journey sacrificed their lives to give us their power.<EOP>
Take this Magicite shard and it will guide you.

[caption #3713]
<A0>: Very good! Keep practicing and you'll be a regular mage someday.

[caption #3714]
<A10>: If it's all right with you, I would like to focus on restorative magic.<EOP>
I don't want to stand by helplessly anymore while people are hurt.

[caption #3715]
<A0>: All right. Try training with this one, then.

[caption #3716]
Duane: The fire went out again.<EOP>
Usually we have <A0> re-light it with her magic.<EOP>
<A10>: It's good that she's been able to provide for you, but you shouldn't be taking her for granted.

The key to growing up is becoming a person people can depend on.<EOP>
Just as you depended on those who came before you.

Here, take this knife and strike a stone against the blade. It will create a spark.

Duane: I did it! I made fire!

[caption #3720]
<A10>: Very good!<EOP>
Hold on to that feeling of pride. Let it drive you seek more ways to provide for yourself and others.

My favorite toy in that box is the model airship!

We had stew today! I actually wanted to eat the vegetables!

I miss Mama, but I'll be okay.

[Oh, Mister Tonberry, would you like a cup of tea?]<EOP>
[Why, thank you, I would love some!]

[caption #3725]
I drawed a picture of me and Mama and Duane and Katarin and the dogs!

Go and rescue this dying world without restraint!

[caption #3727]
Papa <A10> made us stew today! He said it's his favorite army meal.<EOP>
It was better than a rat, at least.

[caption #3728]
I miss Mama, but Papa is nice, too.

This moogle doll will be the Mama because it's soft.<EOP>
This tonberry doll will be the Papa because it has a shiny head.

<A5>: Well, that kid would have been crushed_

<A4>: And so would you!<EOP>
I'd spend all night digging through the rubble to find you!

<A4>: What would the ladies think if I abandoned my little brother?!

<A5>: __Sorry.<EOP>
I'm strong, but I'm not invincible. So I guess I should still be careful.
For you.

Even for just a little bit?

When the world broke apart, monsters swarmed the caves, kupo.<EOP>
My dearest Molulu gave me her charm that keeps monsters away, but that meant I was the only one who_

[caption #3760]
But that means that as long as I'm with you, no monsters will attack you, kupo!

[caption #3761]
But I still need to protect these caves, kupo.<EOP>
As soon as you don't need me, I'll come back here, kupo.

I wish there was some way I could stay with you_

I just had a great idea!

Cid, thank you for taking care of <A6> for us.

[caption #3769]
<A6>: Granddad_I promise I'll bring my friends to meet you.
Every last one.

[caption #3770]
<A6>: Granddad_thank you for everything.

[caption #3771]
<A1>: I_ <D>don't even know what to say_<EOP>
<A6>: You don't have to say anything.

[caption #3772]
<A1>: How can I not?

[caption #3773]
I promised I'd protect you, but when you needed me most, I wasn't there.

[caption #3774]
<A6>: You were, though.

[caption #3775]
This is what gave me hope again. This is what got me through it.<EOP>
The belief that I would see you again is what's kept me going all this time.

[caption #3776]
<A1>: _Sorry I was so hard to find. I guess I was looking for myself, too.<EOP>
But from now on, whenever you need me, I'll always be close by. I promise.

[caption #3777]
<A10>: I wanted to check how you were doing. Do you need to talk?

[caption #3778]
<A6>: I'm doing a lot better now that I've found you and the others.<EOP>
But_ <D>talking would still help, if you'll listen.

[caption #3779]
<A10>: Of course. Any time you need.

[caption #3780]
<A6>: I gave up on the Empire, too. Abandoned it thinking there was nothing worth fighting for there anymore.

[caption #3781]
But you stuck it out.<EOP>
Through all its rot, you still saw hope in it and wanted to nurture that.

[caption #3782]
I don't know whether you were right or not, but<EOP>
Even with the world the way it is, I'm not going to give up on it so easily this time.

[caption #3783]
We still have friends left to find. And I want to believe that we will.<EOP>
If we all work together, I'm sure we can lift it out of this ruin.

[caption #3784]
<A0>: How are you doing?<EOP>
<A6>: Better, now that I've found you and the others.

[caption #3785]
<A0>: I_ <D>know how it feels to work that hard only to fail.
That suffocating hopelessness_<EOP>
But_it doesn't have to be that way forever. One failure doesn't define you.

[caption #3786]
<A0>: I can't even imagine_ <D>working that hard only to fail. What that must feel like.<EOP>
But I hope that you don't let that feeling define you. You've done so much more than that.

[caption #3787]
<A6>: Thank you, <A0>. I'm a lot more hopeful now.<EOP>
All of you have helped me so much.<EOP>
And I know that someday, I'll find <A1> out there, too.

[caption #3788]
<A6>: Granddad, my friends really were out there. I'm not alone anymore.<EOP>
So just like you wanted, I'm going to bring them all here to meet you.
Every last one.<EOP>
I'll be back. I promise.

[caption #3789]
<A6>: Granddad, I've brought some friends to meet you.

[caption #3790]
<A6>: Granddad, you remember <A0>.<EOP>
She's been working hard to find her place in the world and showed me what we can still gain.<EOP>
That we can live a life of our choosing, not necessarily what we were created to be_

[caption #3791]
<A6>: This is <A1>_
I really did find him, Granddad.
And I brought him to meet you, like I promised.

[caption #3792]
He was the one who originally rescued me from the Empire.<EOP>
And I think he's rescued me from myself on more than one occasion_

[caption #3793]
Now that he's here, I know we'll be able to defeat Kefka and restore peace to the world!

[caption #3794]
<A6>: This is <A2>, the retainer of Doma.<EOP>
He didn't trust me at first, and rightfully so.
I'm not proud of my reputation.<EOP>
But I admire his resilience and desire to help those going through similar times of grief.

[caption #3795]
<A6>: This is <A3>.<EOP>
He's_ <D>I actually don't know much of anything about him.<EOP>
But I think he prefers it that way.
It keeps life from getting too complicated.

[caption #3796]
<A6>: This is <A4>, the king of Figaro.<EOP>
He's made plenty of passes a me, but I've always turned him down.<EOP>
But he's competent with rulership and machinery, I'll give him that.<EOP>
He should probaby focus more on that.

[caption #3797]
<A6>: This is <A5>, the prince of Figaro.<EOP>
Like me, he ran away from his nation due to disgust with its politics.<EOP>
But_ he didn't wholly abandon it.
He looked out for it from afar, in his own way.<EOP>
I probably should have been more like him.

[caption #3798]
<A6>: This is <A9>. I had to sing in an opera to lure him into kidnapping me so we could steal his airship.<EOP>
But I think he appreciated the excitement.<EOP>
Sometimes I wish I could be as carefree as he is, but we do our work so others don't have to.

[caption #3799]
<A6>: This is <A7>, a mage from Thamasa and an expert in monsters.<EOP>
He's much older than you, Granddad, but he's not about to retire just yet.<EOP>
He's shown me that we have more time than we think to make a difference in the world.

[caption #3800]
<A6>: This is <A8>, <A7>'s granddaughter.<EOP>
Her paintings slap you in the face with their realism.
Quite literally.<EOP>
She's taught me to never censor yourself and always project your true feelings.<EOP>
<A8>: You're damn right, sister!

[caption #3801]
<A6>: Granddad, you remember General Leo.
Though he just goes by [<A10>] now.<EOP>
He's always been a tempering presence in my life. Firm but fair.<EOP>
I think both of us are learning that we can have a life after the Empire.

[caption #3802]
<A6>: This is <A11>. He was abandoned on the Veldt as a child but survived all the same.<EOP>
He's been handed a terrible lot in life but is still so kind and optimistic.<EOP>
I want to be able to have his kind of resilience.

[caption #3803]
<A6>: This is <A12>. We found them in the belly of a monster.

[caption #3804]
<A6>: __ And that's just a thing they do.
But it helps us see ourselves from the outside.<EOP>
__ I need to wash my hair.

[caption #3805]
<A6>: This is <A13>. He's a yeti.<EOP>
__ That's it. He's a yeti.<EOP>
I just wanted to show you because it's neat.

[caption #3806]
<A6>: This is Mog, a moogle from Narshe.<EOP>
He lost all of his friends, too, and thought he was all alone in the world.<EOP>
We're learning together that we can never replace old friends, but new ones can help us heal.

[caption #3807]
<A2>: I am sorry for thy loss_

[caption #3808]
<A6>: Granddad_?!

[caption #3809]
Cid: <A6>_ <D>
I'm so glad to see that you have so many people to support you.<EOP>
I can rest easy knowing that you're in good hands.<EOP>
I'm sorry that this old body couldn't hold out.
But I'll be with you in spirit<EOP>
Live a good life, <A6>, and bring that hope to everyone else, too.

Wait, you're_ <D>alive?!<EOP>
[Master Banon, what are you doing in a place like this?]

[caption #3814]
Banon: Ha_ <D>Haha_<EOP>
So the Returners haven't been completely wiped out yet_

[caption #3815]
I was single-mindedly focused on using whatever means necessary to defeat the Empire.<EOP>
And now the Empire is gone_
and replaced with something far worse.

[caption #3816]
In the end, what did we even accomplish?
Who did we save?<EOP>
We're even less free than before.

[caption #3817]
I'm tired of fighting a battle I know now is unwinnable.<EOP>
This is the only place left in the world where fighting can still yield worthwhile results.

[caption #3818]
[You're wrong! If we work together, we can bring down Kefka and restore peace to the world!]

[caption #3819]
Banon: __<EOP>
I remember being as idealistic as you once.<EOP>
But reality is a bitter pill to swallow.<EOP>
[Then come with us and we'll change that reality!]

[caption #3820]
Banon: Humm_ <D>
I like the fire in your spirit.<EOP>
But I just can't bear to watch more of you young people die in vain.

[caption #3821]
I will at least come with you to observe_and offer what assistance I can.<EOP>
But I ask that you not give me any false hope.

[caption #3822]
[I promise, Master Banon. The hope we have is real.]

We have responsibilities to our people.<EOP>
People who likely would not have been afforded even this jail cell should they defy the Empire.

[caption #3839]
We are their voice.
Their sword, their shield.<EOP>
If we abdicate that duty, Kefka is all too eager to assume it.<EOP>
Certainly you can imagine what he would do to them.
What he would make them do.

[caption #3840]
<A6>: Then we need to take care of Kefka! For our own people's sakes!

[caption #3841]
Leo: We are a nation of laws, General <A6>.<EOP>
Disregarding them to satiate our private grievances makes us no better than him.

[caption #3842]
Those laws will catch up with Kefka eventually, and he will face justice just as anyone else.<EOP>
<A6>: The same kind of [justice] that still sees him walking free after the murder of thousands?<EOP>
Yet I was immediately jailed for a far lesser offense.

[caption #3843]
I'm not going to play party to that kind of system anymore.

[caption #3844]
Leo: And what does that accomplish?<EOP>
Clearing your own conscience while leaving your subordinates to fend for themselves?<EOP>
The moral high ground cannot be built from the bodies of the innocent.

[caption #3845]
Leo: The people of Doma are dead BECAUSE I abandoned my post.<EOP>
It is my sin to bear and I will not run from it.

I cannot protect my people from behind enemy lines, or from a jail cell.<EOP>
__ or from the gallows_

Leo: So in order to remain in a position where I CAN protect them, I must follow orders.<EOP>
Even if they weigh heavily on my conscience_

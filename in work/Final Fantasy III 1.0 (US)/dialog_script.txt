Biggs: So that's the town?<D24><EOP>
Wedge: Hard to believe an Esper's been found frozen there, 1000 years after the War of the Magi_<D24>

[caption #1]
Biggs: Think it's just another hoax?
Wedge: Maybe_ <EOP>
But if they've sent HER along with us, this might be the real deal. <D24>

[caption #2]
Biggs: This woman who was born with magical powers_<D24><EOP>
I heard she fried 50 of our Magitek Armored soldiers in under 3 minutes.<D24>

[caption #3]
Wedge: Not to worry. The Slave Crown on her head robs her of all conscious thought. She'll follow orders.<D24>

[caption #4]
Wedge: We'll approach from the east.
Move out!<D12>

[caption #5]
 Long ago, the War of the Magi
     reduced the world to a
scorched wasteland, and magic
     simply ceased to exist. <E$FF><OP$12>

[caption #6]
1000 years have passed_ Iron,
gunpowder, and steam engines
  have been rediscovered, and
     high technology reigns_ <E$FF><OP$12>

[caption #7]
    But there are some who
  would enslave the world by
reviving the dread destructive
    force known as [magic.] <E$FF><OP$12>

[caption #8]
        Can it be that those
  in power are on the verge of
       repeating a senseless
        and deadly mistake? <E$2A><OP$12>

[caption #9]
An eerie glow surrounds you.<EOP>
Want info about Save Points?
 <C> Yes
 <C> No

[caption #10]
Wedge: Let's put her on point.
No sense taking any risks.
Forward!

[caption #11]
Wedge: The Esper's gotta be in here.
Move out!

[caption #12]
Guard: Imperial Magitek Armor?
Not even Narshe's safe anymore!

[caption #13]
Guard: Machine-riding,
self-important swine!
Take this!

[caption #14]
Guard: Narshe's freedom depends on us!

[caption #15]
Wedge: According to our source, the frozen Esper was found in a new mine shaft.
_Maybe this one_

[caption #16]
Biggs: I'll handle this.
Stand back!

[caption #17]
Guard: We've got 'em trapped, now!

[caption #18]
Guard: We must defend the mines!

[caption #19]
Locked.

[caption #20]
Girl: Where am I_?

[caption #21]
Old Man: Whoa!
And I only just removed the crown!
<EOP>
Girl: _head_hurts_

[caption #22]
Old Man: Easy! This is a Slave Crown. The others had complete control over you while you were wearing it.

[caption #23]
Girl: I can't remember a thing_
Old Man: Don't worry.
It'll all come back to you_in time, that is.<EOP>
___

[caption #24]
My name_
_is_<A0>_<EOP>
Old Man: Impressive!
You've got a strong spirit to reclaim even that much of yourself so fast.

[caption #25]
Soldier: Open up!
Hand over the girl with the Magitek Armor!

[caption #26]
Soldier: Open this door!
We want that girl!
She's an officer of the Empire!

[caption #27]
<A0>: Empire_?
Magitek Armor_?

[caption #28]
Old Man: Look,
I have to get you out of here!
They're not going to listen to reason.

[caption #29]
Old Man: Over here!

[caption #30]
A mysterious young woman, controlled by the Empire, and born with the gift of magic__

[caption #31]

Please enter a name.

[caption #32]
Old Man: You should be able to escape through the mines out back.  I'll hold them off here.  Hurry!

[caption #33]
Got her!

[caption #34]
She's up there!

[caption #35]
Kefka: My sweet little magic 
user_! Uweee, he, he! With this Slave Crown I'll practically OWN you!!

[caption #36]
Kefka: What's taking so long?!  Why hasn't the squad I sent to Narshe reported back yet? <E$08><OP$12>

[caption #37]
Kefka: Where's my magic user?!
Where's my Esper?!

[caption #38]
Cid: This is my finest work.
These Magitek converters combine the power of magic with machines_

[caption #39]
Gestahl: With our new-found power, nothing can stand in our way!<EOP>
Hurrah!!!
Long live Emperor Gestahl!!!

[caption #40]
Old Man: Took you long enough!
How goes the robbing and plundering trade?

[caption #41]
<A1>: I PREFER the term treasure hunting!<EOP>
Old Man: Ha!
Semantic nonsense!
<A1>: There's a HUGE difference!

[caption #42]
<A1>: Anyway, were you the one who sent for me?<EOP>
Old Man: Yeah.
There's a girl I'd like you to meet.

[caption #43]
<A1>: You mean the girl with the magical powers?

[caption #44]
Old Man: The town's guard is pursuing her even as we speak.<EOP>
I know this town is capable of resisting the Empire.<EOP>
But our pride in our own self-sufficiency has prevented us from joining the Returners, the underground resistance.<EOP>
Even if I try to explain that the girl was only being controlled by the Empire, they won't listen_

[caption #45]
<A1>: All right_
I think we'd better help her_

[caption #46]
Old Man: Agreed.
Make your way first to Figaro, and talk to the king.

[caption #47]
Treasure hunter and trail-worn traveler, searching the world over for relics of the past_

[caption #48]
Guard: Now we gotcha!

[caption #49]
<A1>: Wonderful_
There's a whole bunch of 'em_

[caption #50]

               Kupo_

<A1>: Moogles_!
Are you saying you want to help me?

[caption #52]
Kupo!!!

[caption #53]
Moogle: Use us to save <A0> from the guards!<EOP>
Need more information?
<C> Yes
<C> No

[caption #54]
You'll fight using 3 different groups. Press the Y Button to switch between them.<EOP>
Your job is to defeat the commander of the guards before his men reach <A0>. Save her, or else_

[caption #55]
<A0>: Unh_

[caption #56]
<A1>: Thanks, Moogles!
We're in your debt!

[caption #57]
<A1>: I think this switch'll_

[caption #58]
<A1>: Eh?
You back with us now?!

[caption #59]
<A0>: You_saved me?
<A1>: Save your thanks for the Moogles!

[caption #60]
<A0>: Uhh_I can't remember anything_past or present_

[caption #61]
<A1>: You have amnesia?!

[caption #62]
<A0>: A man said my memory would come back_<EOP>
<A1>: Your memories_ _<D>
Don't worry, I swear I'll protect you!!
<A0>: ???<EOP>
<A1>: I won't leave you until your memory returns!!<EOP>
By the way, this secret entrance might be useful some day.
Don't forget about it!

[caption #63]
Man: You mean, THIS young woman_?!

[caption #64]
<A0>: Who_are you?

[caption #65]
Man: Oh, my apologies!

[caption #66]
Man: How rude of me to turn my back to a lady!

[caption #67]
The young king of Figaro Castle, ally to the Empire, and a master designer of machinery_

[caption #68]
<A4>: I am <A4>, King of Figaro.

[caption #69]
<A1>: Surprised someone like me knows a king?

[caption #70]
<A1>: Talk to you later!

[caption #71]
<A4>: So_you're an Imperial soldier! No problem. Figaro and the Gestahlian Empire are allies!<EOP>
Please, relax while you're here.
It's not in my blood to harm a lady.

[caption #72]
<A0>: Why are you putting so much effort into helping me?
Is it because of my_abilities?

[caption #73]
<A4>: I'll give you 3 reasons:
First of all, your beauty has captivated me!<EOP>
Second_I'm dying to know if I'm your type_

[caption #74]
I guess your_abilities_would be a distant 3rd.

[caption #75]
<A0>: __? <D>
What does that mean?

[caption #76]
<A4>: Guess my technique's getting a bit rusty_

[caption #77]
<A4>: Come find me when you feel rested.

[caption #78]
<A0>: I see_I suppose a normal girl would have felt something from those words. <D>
But I'm hardly_normal_

[caption #79]
Feel free to wander about.

[caption #80]
Go see the King!

[caption #81]
Weapons and items manufactured here are sent to South Figaro.

[caption #82]
I've read that long ago, people were able to use a power called [magic].<EOP>
People who used magic were called [mages].

[caption #83]
Scholars the world over are doing research on magic.
Even though there's no such thing_

[caption #84]
Ancient texts I'm studying speak of a [1000 year-old city beneath the sand.]<EOP>
I wonder what this means, <EOP>
[_when the queen stands and takes 5 steps_]

[caption #85]
I heard the Empire is using something called [magic]_

[caption #86]
The Empire has smashed the 3 cities on the southern continent. Just a matter of time 'til they come up here_

[caption #87]
Gestahl has harnessed the power of magic.
Guess he's gonna conquer the world or something now.

[caption #88]
<A4> loves women of all kinds.  Young or old, if you're female he'll put the moves on you.

[caption #89]
His highness said he'd marry me when I get older!

[caption #90]
I'm gonna marry the king!

[caption #91]
He recently tried to hit on the high priestess_
Surely, he's_talked to you?

Ah! King <A4>!

Error.
Contact a supervisor.
From: Development Team.

[caption #96]
These thieves have been
terrorizing the vicinity.
Stay away from 'em!

[caption #97]
I demand to see <A4>!
How dare they keep us in this stinking pit!

[caption #98]
Phew! _Hey, do you think I stink?

[caption #99]
Relax, they're just blowing off steam. But I'm telling you, there's no sense keeping us here!<EOP>
We're just small potatos compared to the real threat lurking out there! And King <A4> knows it!

[caption #100]
I'm Lone Wolf, the pickpocket!

[caption #101]
Matron: <A4>'s at it again!? He hits on anything that moves!

[caption #102]
Matron: <A4> has a twin brother. He was such a nice boy, always thinking of his family_

[caption #103]
Youth: Brother,
What's wrong with father?
What's all this talk of his successor?<EOP>
<A4>: Are you blind?
Look how thin his face has become!

[caption #104]
Youth: ?__What is it?

[caption #105]
Youth: Brother!

[caption #106]
Youth: Tears__?!

[caption #107]
<A4>'s twin brother, who traded the throne for his own freedom_

[caption #108]
Matron: Yes_
His name is <A5>. I'm sure he's grown into a fine man by now.<EOP>
He was so small and meek compared to <A4> when he left.
I wonder what he's like now?

[caption #109]
Chancellor: The whole business of the succession was so repugnant to <A5>, the King's brother, that__<EOP>
__he fled the castle forever. The succession was settled with a coin toss_

[caption #110]
Merchant: I can't take money from the King!<EOP>
<A4>: Look, don't you have a family?
Don't worry about it and just take it.

[caption #111]
Merchant: Sir <A5>, I can't take your money!<EOP>
<A5>: Take it!
Haven't you heard? My brother says I'm a notorious spendthrift!

[caption #112]
<A4>: I hear you've already overthrown the three southern nations.
So what brings you here?<EOP>
Trooper: That's for us to know!

[caption #113]
Sir Kefka!?
What on earth do_<EOP>
Kefka: Outta my way!

[caption #114]
<A4>: Well?
How do you like my castle?

[caption #115]
King <A4>!
Someone from the Empire to see you!

[caption #116]
<A4>: Probably Kefka!

[caption #117]
Kefka: Phooey!
Emperor Gestahl's stupid orders!

[caption #118]
Kefka: <A4>, you pinhead!
Why do you have to live in the middle of nowhere?<EOP>
When I said I wanted the girl back, I didn't mean I wanted to trudge out here PERSONALLY!<EOP>
My body isn't built for this kind of grunt work.

[caption #119]
Kefka: Ahem_there's SAND on my boots!

[caption #120]
Soldiers: Yes, Sir!
All set, Sir!

[caption #121]
Kefka: Idiots!

[caption #122]
<A4>: I thought we were allies! What are you doing in my domain?<EOP>
Trooper: Allies? The Empire and this back-water, two-bit kingdom?!

[caption #123]
<A4>: What brings Kefka, court mage of Emperor Gestahl, into our lowly presence?<EOP>
Kefka: A girl of no importance recently escaped from us. We heard she found refuge here_

[caption #124]
<A4>: Hmm_this wouldn't have anything to do with this [witch] everyone's been whispering about, would it?<EOP>
Kefka: Lies!
She_merely stole something of minor value.
Is she here?

[caption #125]
<A4>: That's a tough one!

[caption #126]
<A4>: You see, there're more girls here than grains of sand out there. I can't keep track of 'em all!<EOP>
Kefka: I'd hate to be you if we find out you're lying_
Mwa, ha!

[caption #127]
Kefka: I truly hope nothing happens to your precious Figaro_!

[caption #128]
<A1>: I'd say that guy's missing a few buttons_
<A4>: _
Where's <A0>?

[caption #129]
<A4>: Take her to her room_

[caption #130]
<A4>: I'd love to chat with you, but the Chancellor and I must plan our strategy.<EOP>
Sometimes I hate being a king!
If you'll excuse me.

[caption #131]
<A1>: Follow me.

[caption #132]
<A1>: Sorry if we've made you think we only have a business interest in you.  I'm_<EOP>
<A0>: You're <A1>, right? <A4> told me about you.
Is it true you're a thief?

[caption #133]
<A1>: That's TREASURE HUNTER!

[caption #134]
<A1>: On the surface, <A4> pretends to support the Empire.<EOP>
The truth is, he's collaborating with the Returners, an organization opposed to the Empire.<EOP>
I am his contact with that group_

[caption #135]
<A1>: The old man you met in Narshe is one of us.<EOP>
<A0>: Empire_but I'm a soldier of the Empire_!

[caption #136]
<A1>: Not anymore!
You were only being controlled by them.
Things are different now.

[caption #137]
<A0>: I don't understand_
What should I do?
My head_hurts_

[caption #138]
<A1>: What you do from here is up to you.<EOP>
You haven't had much time to think about it yet.
But I'm sure you'll find your way eventually_

[caption #139]
<A0>: Up to me_<D>
But_how do I decide?

[caption #140]
<A4>: _?<EOP>
What the_?!

[caption #141]
<A4>: What's happening?<EOP>
Soldier: It's the Empire!
It's Kefka!

[caption #142]
<A4>: What are you doing?

[caption #143]
Kefka: Bring me the girl. Now!
<A4>: I told you she's not here!<EOP>
Kefka: Then_
welcome to my barbecue!!
Uwa ha ha ha!

[caption #144]
FIRE!!!

[caption #145]
Fire! Fire! Heh, heh heh_

[caption #146]
<A4>: Do it like we planned_<EOP>
Soldier: Yes, Sir!

[caption #147]
Kefka: Changed your mind_?

[caption #148]
<A4>: I guess I have no choice_

[caption #149]
<A4>: Or maybe I do!

[caption #150]
Kefka: Oh my!
It appears Good King <A4> is valiantly abandoning his kingdom!<EOP>
How utterly delightful!

[caption #151]
<A4>: Jump! <E$04><OP$12>

[caption #152]
<A1>: Yahoooo!

Kefka: Go!! GET THEM!

Kefka: Son of a submariner!
They'll pay for this_

<A1>: This is great! <E$06><OP$12>

[caption #160]
<A0>: Were those_bad people?<E$04><OP$12>
I_ <D>I'm scared_

[caption #161]
<A4>: <A0>,
there's someone I'd like you to meet_!

[caption #162]
<A1>: We're members of a resistance organization called the Returners.<EOP>
<A4>: Our mentor, Banon, would certainly like to meet you.<EOP>
[Magic] is going to be the key to winning this war.

[caption #163]
<A0>: [Magic]_

[caption #164]
<A4>: <A0> has magical powers. That Esper seemed to_react to her. Can there be some connection?<EOP>
<A0>: I haven't the foggiest! It just seems natural to me that I have the use of this power_

[caption #165]
<A4>: But no HUMAN is born with the powers you seem to have, and_

[caption #166]
<A4>: I apologize.
<A0>: What should I do_?<EOP>
<A4>: I'm sure the Empire is after you and the secrets to your powers_<EOP>
If they get their hands on you again, the world's finished_<EOP>
<A0>, you want to understand your own powers, right?

[caption #167]
<A4>: That's why I'd like to consult with Banon and shed some light on this.<EOP>
<A0>: __

[caption #168]
<A1>: Please_

[caption #169]
<A4>: OK!
To the south there's a cave that leads to South Figaro.

[caption #170]
This cave leads to South Figaro. However, I cannot let you through at this time.

[caption #171]
Soldier: King <A4>!
Where are you headed?<EOP>
<A4>: Through the cave, and eastward to South Figaro, then north to the Returner hideout.<EOP>
<A4>: Return to the castle, and tell the others we're safe.<EOP>
Soldier: Yes, Sir!
Take care!

[caption #178]
Welcome to South Figaro!

[caption #179]
You'll find lots of excellent weapons, armor and relics in our shops.

[caption #180]
Did you hear?
Figaro Castle sank into the sand!<EOP>
You couldn't find it even if you knew where to look!

[caption #181]
Mt. Kolts is to the east.

[caption #182]
Beyond Mt. Kolts you'll find the Sabre mountain range.

[caption #183]
Equip relics to gain a variety of abilities!<EOP>
These double my walking speed!

[caption #184]
My husband, Duncan, is a
world-famous martial artist!<EOP>
He's taking his disciples to
Mt. Kolts for meditation and training.

[caption #185]
<A5>, where's Vargas?
Where's my husband?

[caption #186]
<A5>: Master is gone_
It was Vargas_

[caption #187]
Duncan's Wife: Why would Vargas do such a thing_<EOP>
Fortunately, my husband taught his most secret techniques to you.

[caption #188]
<A5>: For 10 years you've treated me like a son. I am eternally grateful!

[caption #189]
_.

[caption #190]
<A1>: At the very least you could give me a response_

[caption #191]
<A4>: Stand back!
He seems vaguely familiar_
Wait a minute_!

[caption #192]
He owes allegiance to no one. 
Not a soul has seen the true
face behind his mask_

[caption #193]
<A4>: That's <A3>_!
He'd slit his mama's throat for a nickel!
He's a ruthless assassin.

[caption #194]
<A1>: We should steer clear of him, just to be safe.

[caption #195]
<A3>: Leave us.
The dog eats strangers_

[caption #196]
The guy at the counter_
He's kinda creepy_

[caption #197]
That guy at the counter_HEY! Where'd he go?

[caption #198]
One of Duncan's students looks a lot like you.

[caption #199]
So Duncan's dead.  That's too bad.

[caption #200]
Duncan trained his son, Vargas, in the martial arts, but he complained he wasn't progressing fast enough.

[caption #201]
The house in the northern part of town belongs to our wealthiest citizen.

[caption #202]
The Empire's been invading one town after the next.
We're not safe here!

[caption #203]
Figaro castle turned on the Empire?!<EOP>
Aw man, I don't want to get dragged into the war, too.

[caption #204]
Oh, that's just great,
we've made an enemy of the Empire now_

[caption #205]
This town's defenses are solid!
Even with their Magitek Armor, the Empire won't be able to invade that easily.

[caption #206]
Attack from the east.
That way, <D>__?!<EOP>
Oh! Wh, what do you want? How rude of you to barge in while I'm trying to write a letter!

[caption #207]
Ahem_
Naturally, I am the wealthiest man in this town.

[caption #208]
Oh, what have I done?!
How could I be so tempted by money that I'd pass intel to the Empire?

[caption #209]
Chung chung_
Chung chung_
Magitek Armor!!!!

[caption #210]
My Dad's VERY important so lots of famous people have dinner with him.  Not too long ago even General <A10>_ <D>_<EOP>
Uh, I, uh, just made that up!

[caption #211]
Wind the clock!
Wind the clock!<EOP>
Uh, that was just a jump-rope rhyme!

[caption #212]
Has war really begun?
I'd better return home_

[caption #213]
The Imperial Troops have turned this house into their headquarters.

[caption #214]
There's always a nasty draft in this room. Where's it coming from?

[caption #215]
I don't like strangers.
Bring me some cider, and maybe I'll talk to you.

[caption #216]
What?!
No cider?!

[caption #217]
Hurumph_DOG!

[caption #218]
Ah! Cider!
Glug, glug, _<EOP>
Huh? Secret passage?
Well, there is one that leads to the rich man's house.

[caption #219]
Go downstairs and give my grandson the password. It's_uh, umm_
I forget!

[caption #220]
My grandfather was a servant for the rich family at the north end of town.

[caption #221]
Only people dressed as merchants may pass through.

[caption #222]
Merchant, right?
You may proceed.

[caption #223]
The password is_
<C>[Rose bud]
<C>[Courage]
<C>[Failure]

[caption #224]
You're an Imperial spy!
Can't fool me!

[caption #225]
Secret entrance.

[caption #226]
Good luck!

[caption #227]
Outta the way!
I gotta get this cider over to the old man!
That's my job!<EOP>
Now scram!

[caption #228]
I'm off work.
Get lost!

[caption #229]
Are kids allowed in here?
<D>__What do you think?<EOP>
Oh, all right_

[caption #230]
Hey you!
Come to steal my cider?

[caption #231]
You thief!

[caption #232]
Took the old man's cider!

[caption #233]
The ship isn't going anywhere.

[caption #234]
Imperial troops are milling about.
Gotta jam without being seen!

[caption #235]
Use caution.

[caption #236]
<A4>: Hm_
What's that smell_?

[caption #237]
<A4>: Flowers_
His favorite_

[caption #238]
<A4>: And this_
His favorite tea_

[caption #239]
<A4>: These dishes!
They were his favorite!

[caption #240]
<A4>: <A5>_he was_here?!

[caption #241]
<A4>: Excuse me_

[caption #242]
<A4>: Do you know the man who lives here?

[caption #243]
Man: Of course. He left a couple of days ago after he heard Master Duncan was slain.
He headed into the mountains.<EOP>
I heard Duncan's son, Vargas, is missing as well.
I have a bad feeling about this_

[caption #244]
<A4>: So <A5> was Duncan's student_
To think he's been in the care of someone so renowned_

[caption #245]
Scum!
You're Returners!

[caption #246]
Is that you, <A5>?

[caption #247]
Vargas: So you're with <A5>, huh?

[caption #248]
<A1>: Who're YOU?

[caption #249]
<A1>: Were you the one sneaking around before?
Vargas: Who cares?!

[caption #250]
<A0>: It was you, wasn't it? The student who killed Master Duncan and fled.

[caption #251]
Vargas: Hmph, it's not like the likes of you could take me in.<EOP>
You're going to rue the day you ran into me!!

[caption #252]
<A4>: <A5>?
Is he here?

[caption #253]
<A4>: <A5>!!!

[caption #254]
<A5>: Big brother?

[caption #255]
<A1>: This is your... LITTLE brother?!

[caption #256]
<A0>: [Little]_brother?
I was sure he was one of Vargas's bears_

[caption #257]
<A5>: Bear?!

[caption #258]
<A5>: Bear, huh? I like the sound of that!

[caption #259]
<A5>: Anyway, brother, what are you doing here?
<A4>: We're on the way to the Sabre Mountains.<EOP>
<A5>: To the Returner hideout, no doubt?

[caption #260]
<A5>: So things are finally starting to happen! I've been secretly watching things from afar.<EOP>
I was afraid Figaro was going to turn into an Imperial puppet state.

[caption #261]
<A4>: Our time to strike back has arrived.<EOP>
I can tell the old advisors are sick of going along with the Empire, too.

[caption #262]
<A5>: Think a [bear] like me could help you in your fight?

[caption #263]
<A4>: You'd_join us?
<A5>_!!

[caption #264]
<A5>: I think Duncan would rest easier if he knew his disciple played a part in bringing peace to the world.

[caption #265]
<A1>: Let's get going!

[caption #266]
King <A4>!
This way, please!

[caption #267]
Did you speak with Banon?

[caption #268]
Not even the Empire'd think of looking here for us!

[caption #269]
Aha!

[caption #270]
Welcome!

[caption #271]
Thank you!

[caption #275]
Banon: So is this the girl who reacted to the frozen Esper?
<A0>: Esper_?<EOP>
<A4>: Seemed the Empire had complete control over her.

[caption #276]
Banon: Carrier pigeons brought word that she wiped out 50 of the Empire's best soldiers in a few minutes.

[caption #277]
<A0>: I didn't_!!

[caption #278]
<A1>: <A0>!
<A4>: Master Banon, don't be so harsh!

[caption #279]
Banon: Don't deny it!

[caption #280]
<A4>: Master Banon!
We brought the girl with us.

[caption #281]
Banon: Perhaps you've heard this story? Once, when people were pure and innocent,<EOP>
there was a box they were told never to open. But one man went and opened it anyway.<EOP>
He unleashed all the evils of the world: envy_ <D>greed_ <D>pride_ <D>violence_ <D>control_<EOP>
All that was left in the box was a single ray of light: Hope.

[caption #282]
<A0>: __
Banon: Whatever might have happened, don't think of your own abilities as a curse_<EOP>
And you are that last ray of light, our only hope_

[caption #283]
<A4>: Master Banon!

[caption #284]
Banon: I'm so tired_
Let me rest a while.

[caption #285]

We're a small organization now, but our membership is starting to soar.

[caption #290]
Banon: <A0>_
Talk to everyone here, heed their advice.

[caption #291]
Master Banon?
He went outside a moment ago.

[caption #292]
Welcome back!
Glad you're okay.

[caption #293]
Welcome back!

[caption #294]
Is Master Banon well?

[caption #295]
My wounds are healing.

[caption #296]
The Empire is wiping out Returners everywhere.
We have to discover some means of fighting back, or_

[caption #297]
<A1>: The Empire took away someone precious to me. I've hated the Empire ever since_<EOP>
As long as the Empire continues to do as it pleases, it'll just create more people like me.<EOP>
That's why I joined the Returners.

[caption #298]
Someone dropped a scrap of paper_<EOP>
<C> Toss it in the trash.
<C> Leave it there.

[caption #299]
Banon: Who did this?
Who left this piece of paper here?

[caption #300]
<A0>: But_I don't have anyone I consider [precious]_<EOP>
<A1>: That's not entirely true.<EOP>
On the contrary, I'm sure there's someone who considers YOU precious! So do it for them_

[caption #301]
<A4>: I know it's selfish of us to ask for your help_<EOP>
If we force you, we're no different than the Empire_<EOP>
So we want you to make up your own mind.

[caption #302]
<A5>: I don't really understand what's going on_but I do know my brother is always right.<EOP>
He's always looked out for me. You can trust him, <A0>_

[caption #303]
But don't you DARE tell him I said that!

[caption #304]
Banon: Have you made a decision?<EOP>
Will you become our last ray of hope?
<C> Yes
<C> No

[caption #305]
Banon: You will? Really!!

[caption #306]
<A0>: But_ <D>
I'm scared_

[caption #307]
Banon: I see_

[caption #308]
Banon: I thought as much_

[caption #309]
Banon: You're sure about this?

[caption #310]
I understand your unease.
But even as we speak, innocent lives are being lost_<EOP>
Please. We need your abilities.
This relic will keep you safe.<EOP>

     Received [Genji Glove]!

[caption #311]
We truly need your help!

[caption #312]
Please join us in our battle!

[caption #313]
Banon: The person who possesses this relic need not fear harm.

[caption #314]
Banon: Please, <A0>_
I'd like you to take it with you.

[caption #315]
<A0>: What is this??? <D>

[caption #316]
Banon: If everyone works together we'll be successful.
Never give up hope!

[caption #317]
Banon: A lucky charm. Take it!<EOP>

     Received [Gauntlet]!

[caption #318]
Banon: I have a plan!
Please get everyone together!

[caption #319]
<A0>: Hope_
How can anyone put their hope in me?

S_South Figaro_

[caption #321]
What? WHAT IS IT?

[caption #322]
Banon: What's going on?
What happened?

[caption #323]
<A0>: He's badly wounded!

[caption #324]
Banon: Someone did a number on him_

[caption #325]
E_Empire_took South Figaro_
Coming_this way_unnnh_

[caption #326]
Banon: They've found us_
We haven't a moment to lose!

[caption #327]
<A4>: <A1>!<EOP>
<A1>: I know_
[Someone] has to sneak into South Figaro and slow the Empire down, right?<EOP>
<A4>: This's right up your alley! Good luck!

[caption #328]
<A1>: <A0>_
Please wait for me_
And_please_<EOP>
_don't let a lecherous young king, who shall remain nameless, near you!
<A4>: <A1>!!!

[caption #329]
<A5>: Big brother_
Aren't you EVER going to grow up?

[caption #330]
Banon: What're we going to do?<EOP>
<A4>: We'll escape down the Lete River, and make our way to Narshe. I want to see that Esper for myself_<EOP>
Banon: Right. There's a raft by the back entrance.
It's a gamble, but we're fresh out of options_

[caption #331]
<A4>: You're in danger here. Come with us to Narshe.<EOP>
It'll probably even be a good opportunity for you to understand your abilities_

[caption #332]
Banon: We've no time to dilly-dally. Let's make for Narshe!

[caption #333]
We'll handle things here_
Please leave for Narshe!

[caption #334]
Please take care of Master Banon.

[caption #335]
The Lete River runs through some underground caverns.

[caption #336]
Banon: We all know that the Empire is using Magitek power in battle.<EOP>
What we don't know is how Gestahl has managed to resurrect magic. That's the main point.

[caption #337]
<A4>: I had <A1> look into the rumor that the Empire is forcing the world's finest scholars to study Espers.

[caption #338]
<A1>: The attack on Narshe was over an Esper, too_

[caption #339]
Banon: Right_

[caption #340]
<A0>: You mean there's some connection between Espers and Magitek?<EOP>
Banon: I can only recall one thing linking Espers with Magitek power_

[caption #341]
<A4>: You don't mean_<EOP>
Banon: Indeed!
The ancient War of the Magi_

[caption #342]
[No!]
[It can't be!]

[caption #343]
<A1>: My Grandma used to tell me stories about magical machines_
Could they have been true?

[caption #344]
<A4>: Could that ancient tragedy be playing out once again_<EOP>
Banon: It's hard to say. That all happened 1000 years ago.<EOP>
But historical studies have provided a number of conflicting and frightening theories_<EOP>
According to one theory, humans and machines were infused with powers drained from Espers_

[caption #345]
<A0>: Is that what Magitek power is_?

[caption #346]
<A4>: We can only fight Magitek enemies with Magitek weapons_<EOP>
Banon: No! Then we would only repeat the mistakes of the War of the Magi!
<A4>: Then what do we do?<EOP>
Banon: I was thinking perhaps we could talk to the Esper_
<A1>: Talk to it?!

[caption #347]
Banon: It's risky, but if we have <A0> react with that Esper once again, it might just wake up_<EOP>
<A4>: I wonder if that's wise_?

[caption #348]
Banon: I'm not saying it's a certainty.
Regardless,
we need <A0>'s help.

[caption #349]
<A1>: <A0>_

[caption #350]
<A0>: I'll give it a try!<EOP>
<A5>: This all went in one ear and out the other, but I'm in! Sounds fun!

[caption #351]
Emergency!
Master Banon_

[caption #352]
Banon: What? <D>
What's that noise?

[caption #353]
Uwaaaa!
The Empire's invading!

This raft'll take us to Narshe!

Hop aboard the raft?
<C> Yes
<C> No

[caption #359]
Fleeing the Empire's troops,
Banon, <A4> and <A0> ride the rapids toward Narshe.
But the going won't be easy_

[caption #360]
Head toward Narshe, but protect Banon at all costs.<EOP>
If Banon falls in battle, your journey's over.

[caption #361]
Which way?
    <C> (Straight)

 <C> (Left)      <C> (Right)

Gotta get to Narshe on the fly_

[caption #370]
<A1> has worked hard to stymie the efforts of the Imperial troops. But now he desperately needs to escape_

[caption #371]
Halt!

[caption #372]
<A1>: Ouch!!
I gotta steal me some new clothes, fast!!

[caption #373]
Back inside!

[caption #374]
Gotta get moving!
The attack on Narshe is imminent. Who knows when they'll give the order?

[caption #375]
Imperial soldiers are pigs!
Green Suits live to brawl_

[caption #376]
<A1>: I've seen her before_
Of course! She's one of the Empire's generals!

[caption #377]
Groomed by the Empire as a
Magitek Knight, none have seen 
the woman behind the general_

[caption #378]
Guard: This's what happens to traitors!

[caption #379]
Guard: So even the mighty General <A6> has fallen.

[caption #380]
<A6>: Not as far as the likes of you who prefer to bully innocent civilians_
Guard: Hold your tongue!

[caption #381]
<A6>: Isn't it true Kefka is planning to poison the people of Doma, to the east?
Guard: Shuddap!

[caption #382]
Guard: Hmph. You're getting the axe tomorrow, anyway. Run your mouth while you still can.

[caption #383]
Keep a close eye on her!

[caption #384]
Yes, Sir!
I can go for days without sleep!

[caption #385]
<C> (Remove her chains?)
<C> (Just stand there and stare)

[caption #386]
<A6>: Aren't you a little short for a soldier?
<A1>: Huh? Oh, the uniform!

[caption #387]
<A6>: What do you hope to peddle down here?
<A1>: Oops! Forgot I was wearing these clothes.

[caption #388]
<A6>: And you are_

[caption #389]
<A1>: I'm with the Returners. Name's <A1>.<EOP>
<A6>: Returners!!! I see_
I am General <A6>_<EOP>
Or at least I was. Now I am nothing but a common traitor_

[caption #390]
<A1>: Let's go!
<A6>: !? You would take me with you?

[caption #391]
<A6>: No, it would be futile.
As you can see, I can barely walk as it is_

[caption #392]
<A6>: I am grateful, but_
Even if you were able to escape with me, it is unlikely you could protect me.<EOP>
It is better that I remain here and face my death with dignity.

[caption #393]
<A1>: I WILL protect you!

[caption #394]
<A1>: Trust me! You'll be fine!

[caption #395]
<A1>: Let's go!

[caption #396]
Soldier: _more soup_'n_

[caption #397]
Soldier: _'n some bread, too_
<D>Mumble <D> Mumble_

[caption #398]
<A6>: Wait.

[caption #399]
<A6>: This soldier may carry something to aid our escape_

[caption #400]
<A6>: Why are you helping me?
<A1>: You remind me of someone_

[caption #401]
<A1>: No, it's nothing.
I just want to, okay?!

[caption #402]
<A6>: This passage leads out.

[caption #403]
<A1>: Huh?
<A6>: Something is emerging from the wall!!

[caption #404]
<A1>: Whew!!!
Looks like we're in the clear!

[caption #405]
<A1>: What IS that noise?

[caption #406]
I hear the lady general betrayed the Empire and got locked up!<EOP>
Now with no one in charge here, we can do whatever we want!

[caption #407]
Oh crap!
It's my shift to guard the passage under the northern mansion.<EOP>
Eh, whatever. I'm already this late, a little more won't hurt.

[caption #408]
I heard there are 2 secret tunnels under the rich man's house.<EOP>
One leads out of town, the other to one of these houses_

[caption #409]
Thanks to our informer, this town fell instantly!

[caption #410]
Rascals!
Knock it off!

[caption #411]
<C>(Take off the disguise?)
<C>(But I like these clothes.)

[caption #412]
Lower ranking soldiers are weak but like to brawl.<EOP>
They leave themselves so wide open you could steal the clothes off their backs.

[caption #413]
Hmph!

[caption #414]
Avoid the armored soldiers! They'll kill you just for talking to them!

[caption #415]
Hey, lady_didn't you just bust in here wearing Magitek armor?

[caption #416]
Banon: Please wait!

[caption #417]
Get out of here!
If you don't_

[caption #418]
<A4>: Hold on.
I'm King <A4> of Figaro_
Guard: Liar!!!

[caption #419]

<A4>: This is why I hate dealing with men.
He won't even listen!<EOP>
<A0>: I'm sorry, it's because of me_

[caption #420]
Arvis: Master Banon! King <A4>!
_and <A0>!!!

[caption #421]
Banon: Arvis!
What's happening here in Narshe?<EOP>
Arvis: The town won't side with the Empire or the Returners.
They just won't listen.<EOP>
But with you and the King of Figaro here, then maybe_

[caption #422]
<A4>: First, how are your people doing?<EOP>
Arvis: They're pretty anxious about that Esper in the mines.

[caption #423]
Banon: We believe this young woman is capable of giving us some answers about that Esper.<EOP>
Arvis: The people are naturally curious about it as well.<EOP>
Depending on how we handle this, they may become more accepting of <A0>_

[caption #424]
<A4>: That Esper is either going to save us_or dig us an early grave_

[caption #425]
<A0>: When <A1> first helped me, he fiddled with something right around here.

[caption #426]
<A4>: He told me. Twist this outcropping here and_

[caption #427]
<A4>: Goodness_
<A0>: What's that_?<EOP>
<A4>: I heard there was a place where applicants for the city guard had their strength tested. This must be it_<EOP>
If we follow that light we should reach the other side safely.<EOP>
If we become surrounded, we need to [tag] the red light in order to proceed_

Soldier A: Shhhh!
Do I always have to tell you to keep it down?!
You're hopeless_!<EOP>
Soldier A: Sometimes I feel like General <A10> is the only thing keeping us from becoming Kefka's disposable pawns. <EOP>
I really hope nothing happens to him.
Soldier B: Yeah, no kidding.

[caption #481]
<A5>: What the_?
Where'd these soldiers come from?

This's an Imperial base.
Too many soldiers_

[caption #486]
Soldier A: Hey, have you heard?
Soldier B: Oh, you mean_<EOP>
Soldier A: Shhh! Quiet down.
If Kefka catches us, we're toast.

[caption #487]
Soldier A: It seems like Kefka is trying to drive General <A10> out of the army and make himself a general.<EOP>
Soldier B: Don't even joke about that!
If that happens, I'm outta here. <EOP>
I don't want to end up like one of those poor saps he had his witch fry.

Soldier A: Yes, Sir.
You are Lord Kefka, correct?
How are you today, Sir?<EOP>
Kefka: Please!
Save your petty small talk!<EOP>
If you can't even handle lookout duty, I can find [other] uses for you!

[caption #491]
Soldier B: Hmph!
Who'd ever follow orders from the likes of you?!<EOP>
Soldier B: _One of these days I'm gonna force-feed that guy the dirt off the bottom of General <A10>'s boots.

[caption #492]
Soldier: General <A10>.
I'm sorry to report that the Commander has fallen_

[caption #493]
<A10>: _Call off the attack.
There will be no more lives sacrificed today.

[caption #494]
Soldier: But, General!
I'm ready to lay my life down at any time for the Empire!

[caption #495]
<A10>: You're from Maranda, right?<EOP>
Soldier: Y_yes Sir. Why?

[caption #496]
<A10>: And you have family there? Are you asking that I travel to your home and present them your effects?<EOP>
What would I say to them?
How could I even face them?<EOP>
You're a human being before you're a soldier. Don't be so eager to throw your life away.<EOP>
I'm sure Emperor Gestahl feels the same.

[caption #497]
Soldier: Yes, Sir!

[caption #498]

You've been trying to conquer Doma for three years now and what do you have to show for it?!

[caption #516]
<A10>: This is a delicate operation, Kefka.<EOP>
Doma is an ancient country rich in history and culture.
It would be a travesty to destroy it.

[caption #517]
Kefka: That's right, you go be the hero and plead for the sake of a traitor.<EOP>
I'm sure that'll earn you a gold star on your spotless record.

[caption #518]

Soldier: But, General <A10> said_<EOP>
Kefka: He's no longer here!
I'm in charge now. Hand it over!<EOP>
Soldier: Some of our people are prisoners inside the castle!
If they drink the water_<EOP>
Kefka: Who cares?!
We have no need for people who are stupid enough to get captured!

Kefka: Tch, noisy brat!

While he was off base, there was a plot to poison the Doman water supply. I couldn't do it. I ran_<EOP>
Imperial loyalist soldiers chased me, beat me, and left me for dead_ Now I can barely move_<EOP>
At this rate I doubt I'll ever see Lola's face again_<EOP>

Flowers are blooming in the garden, telling me spring is here.<EOP>

We're an island isolated from the rest of the continent.
You can only get here by boat.<EOP>
By the way_
What does [isolated] mean?

Usually you can get here by following the coast from the north, but right now it's blocked by a rockslide.

Hurry and go help <A0>!

Pshaw! What nonsense!

Narshe is a neutral city.
We want no war here.
But that accursed Empire still_

Wait, Figaro Castle can dive under the sand and travel west to Kohlingen?
Neat!

Only one of them is locked. Now what do ya suppose is inside_?!

A glowing form soared off toward Figaro Castle.
It seemed almost_human.

Curse the day we dug up that Esper! That's what brought the Empire here!

Looks like war's a'comin'!

There's a sasquatch that lives inside the mine_or so I heard.

Lone Wolf, the infamous thief, has been sighted here.
Are my treasures safe?

[caption #928]
Weapon and Armor shops are selling some new stuff for the coming war.

[caption #929]
Maybe we could borrow the Esper's power_ 
Would that even work_?

No one believes me, though_

King <A4>!
Welcome back!

[caption #936]
Gotta admit, seeing Kefka embarrassed like that brought a smile to my face.

[caption #937]
That girl blazing in light flew off past the mountains west of the desert.

[caption #938]
Who'd have thought a person could fly over a mountain range?

[caption #939]
This castle's greatest accomplishment is its ability to move freely across the desert.<EOP>
As long as there's a desert there, it can even move beyond the mountains.

[caption #940]
Wanna get past the mountains?
This castle can't fly, but it can submerge! Find the person in charge of the Engine Room!

[caption #941]
Our alliance with the Empire has been nullified.

_<A0>?? __Oh my_

[caption #1081]
Ramuh: Her life is not in danger. She is simply unable to control herself after using a power she's unaccustomed to.<EOP>
I am Ramuh. The Esper Ramuh.

[caption #1082]
Esper!?

[caption #1083]
[But don't Espers live in another world?]

[caption #1084]
<A6>: But don't Espers live in another world?

[caption #1085]
<A11>: Esper_ live in different world_ right?

[caption #1086]
Ramuh: That doesn't mean we can't live in this world, too. Espers come in a multitude of forms.<EOP>
My form is similar to a human's, so I am able to live here. I need not worry about being recognized as an Esper.

[caption #1087]
[Why would you hide the fact that you're an Esper?]

[caption #1088]
<A11>: Why you no say you Esper?

[caption #1089]
Ramuh: Humans and Espers are incompatible.

[caption #1090]
<A1>: But my grandma told me that Espers and people once lived side by side!<EOP>
Was that just a fairy tale?

[caption #1091]
[But my mother once told me that Espers and people once lived side by side.

[caption #1092]
I heard that Espers and people once lived side by side.
Was that just a fairy tale_?

[caption #1093]
<A11>: <A11> hear story. People and Esper live together long time ago.

[caption #1094]
Ramuh: Ha ha, that was no fairy tale. That was true.
We started out as friends.<EOP>
That was before the War of the Magi_

[caption #1095]
War of the Magi_

[caption #1096]
Ramuh: It took place_long ago. Espers fought humans who were infused with magical power extracted from Espers_

[caption #1097]
After that meaningless struggle, the Espers, fearing their powers would be used again, crafted their own world.<EOP>
They moved there and shut the humans out. It was a world only for Espers.

[caption #1098]
That was until one day 20 years ago when humans stumbled into it. Humans who knew of Espers and Magitek.<E$18><OP$12>

[caption #1099]
Thus began a hunt for Espers. Gestahl extracted magic from those Espers and created his invincible army. <E$18><OP$12>

[caption #1100]
When they recognized this, the Espers constructed a giant gateway and expelled the humans from their world.

[caption #1101]
Ramuh: Even now, Espers who were captured back then are being held in the Empire's Magitek Research Facility_<EOP>
_being drained of their powers_
I fled here to avoid a similar fate.

[caption #1102]
Ramuh: Looks like she's calmed down a little.

[caption #1103]
Ramuh: When I sensed <A0>'s power destabilize, I called her here. She responded to my magical summon.

[caption #1104]
[<A0>'s_an Esper?]

[caption #1105]
Ramuh: No, she's a bit different from us_

[caption #1106]
[<A0> looks like she's in pain.]<EOP>
Ramuh: She harbors anxiety about the nature of her very existence.<EOP>
Her pain is a manifestation of that.

[caption #1107]
[Is there any way we can help her?]

[caption #1108]
Ramuh: When she is able to fully accept herself, her anxiety will likely be quelled.

[caption #1109]
[What should we do_?]<EOP>
Ramuh: I believe one of my brethren being held in Gestahl's Magitek Research Facility can help her.

[caption #1110]
[If we go to the Magitek Research Facility, you're sure we'll find your people?]

[caption #1111]
<A6>: Huh? The Magitek Research Facility?
Your people_ are in there?

[caption #1112]
<A11>: Magitek Research Facility_?
Your people_ there?

[caption #1113]
<A6>: The Magitek Research Facility_
That place_

[caption #1114]
Ramuh: I abandoned my brethren, escaping here and living in hiding alone.
Even still, I haven't much time.

[caption #1115]
[What do you mean?]

[caption #1116]
Ramuh: Gestahl's methods are incorrect. Draining an Esper of its power by force results in imperfect magic.<EOP>
True magic is only obtained when the Esper becomes Magicite_

[caption #1117]
[Becomes what?!]<EOP>
Ramuh: When we will ourselves to become Magicite, we can bestow you with our power.
[Magicite_?!]<EOP>
Ramuh: When an Esper dies, its power remains in this world as Magicite_
[?!]

[caption #1118]
Ramuh: These are my comrades who fell while escaping the Empire. And I will give you my power, as well_

[caption #1119]
[Why would you go this far_?]

[caption #1120]
Ramuh: If you make use of our power, you can reverse this planet's descent into death_<EOP>
You must stop them. The War of the Magi must never be repeated_

[caption #1121]

<A4>: Let's talk on the way back.

[caption #1137]
<A4>: The Empire's trying to drain magic from Espers_ <E$10><OP$12>

[caption #1138]
<A5>: This can't be true_
<A6>_? <E$10><OP$12>

[caption #1139]
<A6>: I don't remember because they put us to sleep when they gave us the Magitek infusion.<EOP>
But I've heard rumors to that effect.

[caption #1140]
<A2>: Then we shall infiltrate the Empire.<EOP>
<A4>: We'd best split into 2 groups.
We still need to beef up our defenses in Narshe.

[caption #1141]
<A2>: Indeed.

[caption #1142]
<A6>: I'll go to the Empire. You'll need someone with inside knowledge_<EOP>
<A5>: But alone_?

[caption #1143]
<A1>: Don't worry, I'll go with her.

[caption #1144]
<A6>: <A1>!

[caption #1145]
<A2>: Should thou perhaps take a few others?

[caption #1146]
<A1>: Please wait for us in Narshe. We'll find our way back safely.<EOP>
[If you wish to change group members, head for Narshe.]

[caption #1147]
<A3>: There's no need for me to remain with you.

[caption #1148]
<A6>: Having decided that, the Empire is on the continent to the south. No boats go there_<EOP>
<A1>: The people of Jidoor, a town to the south, probably have a way. They're rich, after all.

[caption #1149]
<A6>: <A1>.<EOP>
<A1>: Yeah?
<A6>: Why are you coming with me?

[caption #1150]
<A1>: Well_
There's talk of a legendary treasure there.<EOP>
I just want to have a peek around the Empire to see what I can turn up.

[caption #1151]
Ain't no easy way to make the Imperial lands_!

[caption #1152]
Only way to reach the Empire's by air. Of course you realize you'd need an airship!

[caption #1153]
There's only one airship in the world. It's owned by a gambler, or should I say pirate_?

[caption #1154]
The gambler likes flashy shows. He's always at the opera. I think he likes the beautiful divas_

[caption #1155]
You're the spittin' image of Maria! Huh? Haven't heard of her? She's a famous opera singer!

Impresario: Sorry_my mistake.
Wow, you could pass for Maria in a heartbeat! Hoo boy, now I really am in trouble_

[caption #1171]
<A1>: Right!

[caption #1172]
Impresario: Dear me, NO!
You'll ruin the performance!
I'll lose my job!

[caption #1173]
<A6>: Then you're history!<EOP>
Impresario: This is simply horrid! I want the performance to be a success!<EOP>
But I don't want Maria to be abducted_!

[caption #1174]
<A1>: We'll let him grab her_

[caption #1175]
<A1>: We'll use <A6> as a decoy. After she's abducted, I'll follow 'em right to his airship!

[caption #1176]
Impresario: Are you mad?!!
If something should happen to Maria_

[caption #1177]
<A1>: That's why the decoy! We'll hide Maria somewhere safe!<EOP>
Impresario: Come again?

The Empire's made me a rich man.

[caption #1280]
<A6>: Stop thinking of yourself. Many towns and villages have been smashed by the Empire.

<A4>: The Empire and my realm were allies_
until recently.

<A5>: The Empire'll end up owning you!

[caption #1291]
<A6>: But I have conditions_

[caption #1292]
We'll decide with a coin toss.<EOP>
If it's heads, you'll help us. If it's tails, I'll go with you.
Well, Mr. Gambler_?

<A1>: This ship's going to stick out like a sore thumb. Better land some distance away.<EOP>
<A9>: Right.
I'll wait on board in case of an emergency.

[caption #1309]
<A9>: What's going on?
The Empire's becoming paranoid!

[caption #1310]
<A9>: I'll have to repair the air ship. Go scout around and let me know what's happening.

But she was forced to become a Magitek Knight, and has done some awful things.<EOP>
If I could only talk to her_
I'd apologize for the way her life has turned out.

Cid: No! It's Kefka!

<A9>: Huh?

[caption #1412]
Kefka: Crud!
What a mess!!

[caption #1413]
<A9>: We'll talk later.
Let's get outta here!

[caption #1414]
Kefka: I don't think so_!
You won't get away!

[caption #1415]
<A1>: I'm worried about <A0>. Let's return to Zozo.

[caption #1416]
<A9>: <A0>?
Who's that?<EOP>
<A1>: I'll explain on the way_
_about <A0>_Espers_the Returners_

Maduin: Listen well, and think clearly!<EOP>
What will you do?
<C>(Return together?)
<C>(Leave her here?)

[caption #1425]
She's pretty weak.
Better let her rest for a moment.

[caption #1426]
Elder: Did I hear there was a human here?<EOP>
Maduin: Probably_
_wandered in here by mistake.

[caption #1427]
Elder: This evening is an ill omen_

[caption #1428]
You okay, Maduin?

[caption #1429]
You'd better do away with it. Humans and Espers are incompatible_

[caption #1430]
You're the Gate Keeper, Maduin?

[caption #1431]
Everyone here's feeling uneasy.

[caption #1432]
You just want to peer into the human realm beyond the north gate, eh, Maduin?

[caption #1433]
Why'd you bring that thing here?

[caption #1434]
Strong winds_
Be careful, Maduin.

[caption #1435]
The link between worlds has surely weakened over the past 1000 years.

[caption #1436]
You okay Maduin?

[caption #1437]
Do you even know what you've done?

[caption #1438]
Elder's orders_
No one passes through the gate.

Emergency!
Something's coming through the gate!

Girl: You're_an Esper?
What's that pendant for?

[caption #1445]
Maduin: It's_yours now!
It helps protect the Esper World.<EOP>
Girl: Esper World_
Boy, did I take the low road or what?<EOP>
Maduin: The Esper folk are pretty upset, you being a human and all_<EOP>
Girl: You the one who_saved me?

[caption #1446]
Esper: I am Maduin.
I tired living in the human world_<EOP>
That world is filled with desire, greed and loathing. It's highly infectious_

[caption #1447]
Maduin: Are humans and Espers
truly_so different?

[caption #1448]
Madeline: So_I'm an example of the evil in this world, huh?
Maduin: No, I mean_

[caption #1449]
Madeline: I'll return to my world tomorrow!
Maduin: You'll need a guide.

[caption #1450]
Elder: Everything all right?
WHAT? The human's gone?

[caption #1451]
If this generation of humans knew about our abilities_
And decided they wanted to utilize our powers_<EOP>
It would be a total disaster!

[caption #1452]
A human girl made it all the way to the gate!

[caption #1453]
Why has this happened now after all these years?

[caption #1454]
Youth: What's wrong, Maduin?

[caption #1455]
Maduin: If you don't want to return to your world, you may stay here.<EOP>
Madeline: But humans and Espers can never coexist_!

[caption #1456]
Maduin: How do we know for sure unless we observe for ourselves?

[caption #1457]

    How do we know_

[caption #1458]

        unless we_

[caption #1459]

Maduin: We've given her a name_
Madeline: What?<EOP>
Maduin: It's <A0>.
Not bad, huh?

      2 years later_

[caption #1462]
Humans!!!!!
The nexus between our worlds has opened again!! The wind_
so odd_just like 2 years ago_

[caption #1463]
But something's different now_
Troops have come seeking our magical power.

[caption #1464]
Blast it!
They've made it as far as the Elder's house!

[caption #1465]
Gestahl: Aha!
We've finally found it!<EOP>
Those ancient writings told us of this world, and described the awesome magical properties of these beasts!

[caption #1466]
Gestahl: Grab them!
Riches to any man who captures an Esper!
GO!

[caption #1467]
Elder: We've no choice_
We must do what we've been avoiding_<EOP>
Maduin: You mean_
the magic barrier?

[caption #1468]
It's dangerous out there!

[caption #1469]
Soon the humans will arrive!

[caption #1470]
Madeline: <A0>'s all right.

[caption #1471]
Elder: Here's the plan. We'll cause a tempest that'll sweep all the nasty creatures out of our realm.<EOP>
Then we'll seal the gate_
I am the last of our kind able to cast this magical seal.

[caption #1472]
Maduin: But in your state, you might just_<EOP>
Elder: Pass away_
but at least we will finally be safe.
Maduin: Madonna__

[caption #1473]
Madeline: I, for one, will not miss the other side_

[caption #1474]
Elder: Let's do it.
We have no other choice.

[caption #1475]
Esper: This is all because of that human girl!<EOP>
Maduin: Nonsense!<EOP>
Esper: I'm sure she helped the others find us!

[caption #1476]
Maduin: Get a grip on yourself!<EOP>
Esper: No! She's one of them!
Soon she'll be wearing our hide!

[caption #1477]
Maduin: Urghhh!

[caption #1478]
Madeline took <A0> to the gate!

[caption #1479]
Elder: Where are you going?! D' goh!
Maduin: Madeline's getting drawn into the next world_!<EOP>
Elder: Impossible!
It's too late! I've already begun casting the barrier. There's no turning back!<EOP>

<A0>: That was my father_?

[caption #1491]
<A0>: I'm the product of an Esper and a human_
That's where I got my powers_<EOP>
Now I understand_
I finally feel I can begin to control this power of mine_

[caption #1492]
<A4>: So Gestahl must've known the secret of the Espers' power back then.<EOP>
<A1>: And those Espers at the facility were grabbed during that expedition!<EOP>
That means <A6>'s power came__
at the expense of an Esper_

[caption #1493]
<A5>: They can't get away with this! We have to strike back!

[caption #1494]
<A0>: What's happening in Narshe?<EOP>

Maybe we should head back that way.

How long can things keep going on like this?

When peace was reached, the soldiers left our town.

The Imperial troopers are gone! Let's dance! Let's sing!

[caption #1554]
I was forced into the Empire's army. They made me do some awful things_

[caption #1555]
I feel a little down_

[caption #1556]
Most of the town's youths were led off to serve as Imperial troopers.

[caption #1557]
Our poor kids'll be back soon, won't they?

[caption #1558]
I heard there's a huge gate deep inside a cave to the east.

[caption #1559]
Time to put Tzen back together!

[caption #1560]
Our royal family was slaughtered by the Empire.

[caption #1561]
Thanks to you people peace has been achieved!

Some friendly advice! There's a weapon called the Guardian.
It can't move, but it's very powerful. Run, if you meet it!

so you can't go out!

Waaah! I wanna play outside!

Our kid's still not home.
Even though we said it was dangerous outside!

Business is picking up in the port! Maybe economy will make a recovery!

[caption #1580]
How could an island float in the sky?!

[caption #1581]
They say there's something valuable to the east_
The Empire built a base there, and no one may enter.

[caption #1582]
I heard some Espers flew outta the mountains near the base and thrashed the troopers there!

[caption #1583]
Yeah, thanks to that flying island, this town was shrouded in darkness!

[caption #1584]
We have to bribe the troopers to do business here_

[caption #1585]
And they're such TIGHTWADS!
They're raking in the cash!

[caption #1586]
Wouldn't want to be in their shoes, though!

[caption #1587]
People're disappearing,
islands are flying_
I have a bad feeling about this_

[caption #1588]
Vector, capital of the Empire, is at the center of this continent.

[caption #1589]
You'll find some good weapons and items in Tzen and Maranda.

[caption #1590]
Some strange guy's tryin' to sell glowing stones_
When I wouldn't take one, he said he was going to Tzen.

[caption #1591]
I'm a scholar of magic. Monsters on this continent have only weak magical power.

I found this in a 1000 year-old text:
8 dragons seal away this awesome beast.<EOP>
Its name is Crusader_
Defeat these dragons, and its power can be released_

[caption #1593]
I'm a scholar of weapons. 1000 years ago, during the War of the Magi, 2 so-called Atma Weapons existed.<EOP>
One changed a person's power into a sword, the other was an monster, bred for mass destruction.

No entry into the port!

Hey_you're not of the Empire!

In any case, you're probably broke!

Ahaaa!!
Whooopie!

Look out if you're caught working with the Returners.

[caption #1600]
Now maybe we can get on with our lives.

I heard that Espers attacked the Empire_

[caption #1602]
All's well!

[caption #1603]
Is the war really over_?

[caption #1604]
Nuts!
These soldiers are absolutely insane!

Since the soldiers are leaving, business is bound to pick up. Oops_better keep my mouth shut.

Banon: Oh, you're here!
The people of Narshe have finally decided to battle the Empire.<EOP>
How did it go at Vector_?

[caption #1613]
Arvis: I see_ Your plan would combine Narshe's money with Figaro's machinery to storm the Empire_<EOP>
not enough manpower, though_

[caption #1614]
Banon: We have to open the sealed gate_

[caption #1615]
<A0>: To the Esper World_?

[caption #1616]
Arvis: We'll never beat the Empire without them.

[caption #1617]
Banon: When the gate has been opened, the Espers can attack from the east.<EOP>
We'll storm in at the same time, from the north.

[caption #1618]
Banon: We MUST get the Espers to understand.<EOP>
We have to establish a bond of trust between humans and Espers. Only one person can do this_

[caption #1619]
Half human, half Esper_
My existence is proof
that such a bond CAN exist_

[caption #1620]
<A0>_

[caption #1621]
<A0>: I'll do it.
I'm the only one who can!

[caption #1622]

No way around it.

[caption #1624]
Narshe'S Elder: Our battle lies before us. We must make ourselves ready.

Banon: Get the Espers to understand, and we can bring this war to a screeching halt.<EOP>
<A0>_
I know you can do this_

[caption #1626]
Arvis: The sealed gate stands at the eastern edge of the Empire.<EOP>
There's a base there, but somehow we'll have to slip through_

Can you sense anything, <A0>?

[caption #1628]
<A0>: __

[caption #1629]
<A1>: <A0>_

[caption #1630]
The Espers wouldn't give us the time of day without_

But why do I feel so wretched?

[caption #1632]
That's odd_<EOP>
No Imperial soldiers_

Kefka: D_

I won't forget this!

I'm sure peace is within our grasp!

[caption #1655]
<A0>: I'm all right.
I'm sure peace is within our grasp!

[caption #1656]
<A1>: I can't believe we played a major role in it all!

[caption #1657]
<A1>: I'm sure the Espers were headed for Vector_

[caption #1658]
<A2>: The Empire deserves the worst!

[caption #1659]

Why am I here_? <D>
For the money, I guess.

[caption #1661]

[caption #1662]
<A4>: We can't be smug. We must be thinking of our strategy.

[caption #1663]
<A4>: Somehow we need to tap in to the power of those Espers_

[caption #1664]
<A5>: Let me at the Empire!

[caption #1665]
<A5>: Let's see what's become of the Empire! Hurry!

[caption #1666]
<A6>: I was one of the Empire's generals, but I still know evil when I see it.

[caption #1667]
<A6>: Kefka's sure to come up with another demented plan. We need to do something FAST!

[caption #1668]
<A7>: In all my travels, and in all my years_

[caption #1669]
<A7>: _I've never seen anyone so sleazy as Kefka.

[caption #1670]
<A8>: I know.
Let me draw their portraits!

[caption #1671]
<A8>: I'm sure those Espers are all very kind!

The Espers flew off together_

Then, the Empire's citizens ran off, as though they were terrified.

[caption #1684]
Which way did the Espers go?

[caption #1685]
Toward the capital_

There's something under the ground_

MAJESTY: General <A10>'s waiting in Albrook. Please head for Crescent Island and look for the Espers_

[caption #1782]
Gestahl: Hmm_
Well, let's let him stew in his cell for a while. Then we'll decide what to do.

[caption #1783]
<C> Why'd you start the war?
<C> Why do you want peace now?
<C> Why'd we have to talk to 
      your men?

[caption #1784]
Gestahl: My desire for power got the best of me.
Now I've come to my senses.

[caption #1785]
Gestahl: I feel we need each other's help at this time_

[caption #1786]
Gestahl: Some of my men refuse to embrace peace. I felt they'd understand if they actually met you face to face.

[caption #1787]
Gestahl: With your permission, I'd like to talk about the Espers_

[caption #1788]
<C> One more question please!
<C> Okay.

[caption #1789]
<C> One more question please!
<C> Let's talk about Espers_

[caption #1790]
Gestahl: I assure you, I have answered your questions truthfully.

[caption #1791]
Gestahl: My Empire's been decimated by the Espers that emerged from the sealed gate.<EOP>
They're acting spiteful. Unless they're stopped, they'll rip the world asunder!

[caption #1792]
<C> Yes, the Espers have gone
     too far.
<C> But you unleashed their
     power!!

[caption #1793]
Gestahl: After the Espers went on their rampage, I knew I couldn't go on with my war.<EOP>
I asked myself why I had started it in the first place.
By the way_<EOP>
About those questions you asked me_
which did you ask first?

[caption #1794]
Gestahl: Right. Anyway, more than anything I want peace. That's my true dream. I want you to understand that!

[caption #1795]
Cid: You seem a bit tired.
Care for a rest break?

[caption #1796]
<C> Yes, let's take a break.
<C> Let's keep talking.

[caption #1797]
Shall we begin again?
<C> Yes
<C> No

[caption #1798]
Gestahl: Is there anything you wish to hear me say?

[caption #1799]
<C> That all you really want
     is peace.
<C> That your war's truly over.
<C> That you're sorry_

<C> Sure
<C> Sorry

[caption #1804]
Gestahl: I understand.
My only dream in life is_peace! Now I must ask for a favor_

[caption #1805]
Gestahl: I understand.
I've ordered this war to be over! Now I must ask for a favor_

[caption #1806]
Gestahl: I understand.
I'm truly sorry for what I've done! Now I must ask for a favor_

[caption #1807]
Gestahl: After they devastated my Empire, the Espers headed northward, toward Crescent Island.<EOP>
They must be found_!
We must tell them we're no longer their enemy.<EOP>
After all that I have put them through, it is up to me to set things right.<EOP>
That is why_ <D>
I need to borrow <A0>'s power.

[caption #1808]
Only <A0> can bridge the gap between Esper and human.

<A5>: Didn't I see you at Doma?
_I'm SURE I did_
So that was General Leo_

[caption #1814]
<A10>: You! You're <A2>, liege to the king of Doma!
Please forgive me for not being there to stop Kefka_<EOP>
<A2>: __
That wasn't your fault.

[caption #1815]
<A10>: I'll be waiting for you in Albrook.

[caption #1816]
Gestahl: We must find the Espers and come to terms with them! You are our last hope!

[caption #1817]
<A1>: If <A0> goes, I'll go.

[caption #1818]
<A0>: <A1>_
Thank you_

[caption #1819]
<A1>: The rest of you wait here. I smell a rat_

[caption #1820]
<A4>: Agreed_
It's hard to trust the Emperor just like that_

[caption #1821]
<A2>: We'll stay here and investigate.

[caption #1822]
<A1>: Please do.
Leave no stone unturned!

[caption #1823]
<A4>: Right.
And you be careful!

[caption #1824]
Gestahl: I truly apologize about the poisoning of Doma.
No one dreamed Kefka would use poison.

[caption #1825]
<C> What's done is done_
<C> That was inexcusable.
<C> Apologize again!!

[caption #1826]
Gestahl: I'm so terribly sorry! Kefka's being severely punished, and we're cleaning up the poison.

[caption #1827]
Gestahl: By the way_
With regard to General <A6>_

[caption #1828]
<C> Was she an Imperial spy?
<C> <A6> is one of us!
<C> We trust <A6>!

[caption #1829]
Gestahl: Kefka was lying.
General <A6> realized the war was stupid before anyone else.<EOP>
That's why she joined the returners. Any other questions for me?

The dog usually doesn't like people, though_

She's just young.
<A1>: Hmmm_<EOP>
<A7>: This is just a back-water village. We can tell you nothing about your Espers_

She was at a neighbor's house when a fire broke out. I won't be able to stand it if something happens to her!

<D>We really have no choice.

[caption #1995]
Mayor: Stand back.

[caption #1996]
<A7>: It's no use.
The fire's too strong!<EOP>
Mayor: I think that's because they keep so many Fire Rods in here_

[caption #1997]
<A7>: I'm going in!

[caption #1998]
<A0>: Wait_I'm going too.
<A1>: Count me in. You'd better stay out here, gramps.<EOP>

<A7>: Are you okay?
<A8>: Yes. Thanks, Grandpa!

[caption #2007]
<A7>: Save your thanks for these people.
<A8>: Thank you_

[caption #2008]
<A7>: I guess our town's little secret is out now_

[caption #2009]
<A1>: Can everyone here use magic? What's going on here?

[caption #2010]
<A7>: This is_
<D>_the village of the Mage Warriors_

[caption #2011]
<A7>: Long ago humans used Magicite to gain magical powers. They came to be known as Mage Warriors.

[caption #2012]
<A1>: But I thought they perished centuries ago_

[caption #2013]
<A7>: After the War of the Magi, the Espers fled to their new world behind the sealed gate.<EOP>
They wished to live peacefully, without fear of being used by humans. They left us here to fend for ourselves_<EOP>
But we were despised by normal people. Everyone felt we had begun that war_

[caption #2014]
<A7>: They sent people to hunt us down like animals.
There weren't even any trials_<EOP>
<A0>: Even though the only difference was that you could use magic_?

[caption #2015]
<A7>: A few Mage Warriors escaped and found their way here. They were our ancestors.<EOP>
Our powers have weakened over time, but some of it remains.

[caption #2016]
<A0>: Look, if you're up to it, we could use your help. <D><EOP>
<A7>: So, you're after the Espers, eh_?

[caption #2017]
<A7>: Well, I owe you for saving <A8>. <D>I'll help you find your Espers.

[caption #2018]
<A8>: Me too! <D>
<A7>: I don't think so.

[caption #2019]
<A8>: What a fuddy duddy_

[caption #2020]
<A1>: But_where do we start looking?<EOP>
<A7>: Hmm_
<D>If they're here, they must be  hiding in the mountains to the west.

[caption #2021]
<A1>: Why there?
<A7>: Those mountains have powerful magical properties.<EOP>
They say the Espers were created there_

[caption #2022]
<A0>: Maybe they're drawn to that place?

[caption #2023]
<A1>: I think it's worth a look.

[caption #2024]
<A3>: Don't misunderstand me. I just wanted my dog back.

[caption #2025]
<A1>: Going somewhere?
<A3>: I'll search for the Espers in my own way.

[caption #2026]
Ultros: G'heh, heh_these shiny statues are all mine!
These'll get Ziegfried's attention!

[caption #2027]
Ultros: Oh!
They're glowing!!
They're_beautiful!

[caption #2028]
<A1>: Hey, squidball!
Don't you ever learn?<EOP>
Ultros: Uh, well they always said I was a slow learner_
but I eat FAST!!

[caption #2029]
<A8>: Hey! Did you see me? I was awesome!
Wouldn't I be more helpful than Gramps?<EOP>
<A7>: G_GRAMPS!!?

[caption #2030]
<A0>: I suppose it wouldn't hurt to have you along_

[caption #2031]
<A7>: I can't believe it_
<D>The Statues_!
<A0>: [The] Statues?!

[caption #2032]
The birth of magic_<EOP>
3 goddesses were banished here. In time they began quarreling, which led to all-out war.<EOP>
Those unlucky humans who got in the way were transformed into Espers, and used as living war machines_

[caption #2033]
<A1>: Some faint letters are carved on the back of the stone figures_

[caption #2034]
<A1>: Say, old man, what else can you tell us about these goddesses?

[caption #2035]
<A7>: They quite literally created magic, as we know it.<EOP>
<A1>: So, they're the goddesses of magic, then?
<A7>: You could say that.

[caption #2036]
<A0>: I can feel their power_
<A7>: The Statues are the source of all magic.<EOP>
It's said the Espers made these images, and put them in a very special place.<EOP>
These represent power beyond all comprehension_

[caption #2037]
<A0>: Our Espers no doubt came to this island to bask in all this magical power!

[caption #2038]
The goddesses finally realized that they were being laughed at by those who had banished them here.<EOP>
In a rare moment of mutual clarity, they agreed to seal themselves away from the world.<EOP>
With their last ounce of energy they gave the Espers back their own free will, and then transformed themselves_<EOP>
_into stone.
Their only request was that the Espers keep them sealed away for all eternity.

[caption #2039]
The Espers created these statues as a symbol of their vow to let the goddesses sleep in peace.<EOP>
The Espers have sworn to keep the goddesses' power from being abused.

[caption #2040]
<A1>: Phew_what a story.<EOP>
<A0>: If the Espers were attracted here by these statues, they must be around here somewhere!

[caption #2041]
<A1>: Say, old timer,
what happened to the stone goddesses?<EOP>
<A7>: Legend has it that they're hidden somewhere beyond the reach of humans.<EOP>
I'd say they're beyond the sealed gate_

[caption #2042]
<A0>: I wonder if the barrier that protects that place is generated by those stone goddesses?

[caption #2043]
<A8>: Are these_Espers?!

[caption #2044]
<A0>: I didn't think they'd look so_ <D><EOP>
<A1>: Gramps, take <A8> and clear outta here!

[caption #2045]
<A7>: What about you?

[caption #2046]
Yura: Halt!

[caption #2047]
<A8>: What is it?
<A7>: I sense some immense magical power in <A0>_ <D>It_frightens me_

[caption #2048]
<A1>: I wonder if she's gonna go ballistic again?!

[caption #2049]
Yura: You're somehow different_
<D>I sense a familiar power radiating from you_<EOP>
<A0>: Yes.

[caption #2050]
<A7>: You're the Espers that fled through the sealed gate?<EOP>
Yura: As a rule, we are not allowed to visit to your world.<EOP>
We few had gathered near the gate, and were wondering how we could save the Espers that had been kidnapped.<EOP>
It was just a coincidence that <A0> appeared when she did_

[caption #2051]
<A0>: I felt_
your presence_
through the gate.<EOP>
Yura: We bolted the moment <A0> opened the gate.
But once in your world, we lost control of our powers.

[caption #2052]
Yura: We completely leveled a city_and took some innocent lives_

[caption #2053]
<A0>: That's what happened to me! I lost all control of my power_

[caption #2054]
<A7>: There must be something in your world that allows you to focus your power differently.<EOP>
You must use caution while in our world_

[caption #2055]
Yura: We are deeply sorry to have caused you humans such suffering and pain.

[caption #2056]
<A1>: The past is history. The Empire seems to want to talk peace with you. Why not come with us?<EOP>
Yura: They would forgive us so easily?

[caption #2057]
<A1>: Let's go to Thamasa and talk with General <A10>.
<A0>: Right!

[caption #2058]
<A1>: General <A10>.<EOP>
<A10>: <A1>_you're back! And you've made the Espers understand our desire for peace!

[caption #2059]
<A10>: I am General <A10>.
May I have your name, please?
Yura: I am called Yura.

[caption #2060]
Yura: We have done something inexcusable to your people.<EOP>
Yura: This probably isn't the time or place to ask for your forgiveness, but_

[caption #2061]
<A10>: Speak no further.
It is we who owe you an apology. We hungered for your power_<EOP>
How close we came to reenacting the War of the Magi!!!<EOP>
Yura: We must put this all behind us.

[caption #2062]
Kefka: I don't care for the appearance of this pitiful little hamlet_
So burn it!!

[caption #2063]
<A1>: I believe our job is finally over! I, for one, could use some peace and quiet_<EOP>
<A6>: Let's return to Vector.

[caption #2064]

Kefka: G'ha, ha, ha! Emperor's orders!<EOP>

Kefka: Shut up!

[caption #2069]
M.Tek Trooper: General <A10>, prepare yourself!

[caption #2070]
<A10>: No.
I won't let this happen!

[caption #2071]
<A10>: Kefka!
<D>Your behavior is dishonorable!
I can't allow this!

[caption #2072]
Kefka: Hee, hee_!
How 'bout a little Magitek mayhem!

[caption #2073]
Kefka: Now for a little Magicite hocus-pocus_!

[caption #2074]
Kefka: Whoa! Yes, I feel some incredible magic power here, today! Wave after wave of pure, magical energy_

[caption #2075]
Kefka: I'd say you're all charged up, boys and girls_or whatever_<EOP>
Say, remind me to show you my Magicite collection someday! You might see a few familiar faces!!!

[caption #2076]
Kefka: First, let's neutralize your abilities.

[caption #2077]
Kefka: Now, little Espers_
Let's see whatcha got!

[caption #2078]
Kefka: This is ridiculous!
I had no idea you were such wimps! <D>Time to put a stop to all of this.

[caption #2079]
Kefka: Eh?!
You wanna take me on?
Fine. Here I am_

[caption #2080]
Kefka: Phew_
I think I have plenty of Magicite for the time being_<EOP>
that is, until I make my way through your precious sealed gate!!

[caption #2081]
It hurts_

[caption #2082]
Curse the Empire_Curse Kefka!

[caption #2083]
The Espers_are they all_?

[caption #2084]
Mayor: I can only take some comfort in the fact that there were so few casualties.

[caption #2085]
<A0>: General Leo_

[caption #2086]
<A0>: People only seem to want power. Do they really want to be like me?

[caption #2087]
<A0>: I_I wanted to learn so much more from you_

[caption #2088]

That's a nasty wound!

[caption #2093]
<A1>: Now I'm worried about <A4> and the others_<EOP>
<A0>: I wish I could say they were safe_

[caption #2094]
<A9>: We've been had!!
The Emperor is a liar!

[caption #2095]
<A2>: Thanks to <A4>, we escaped before anything bad happened_

[caption #2096]
<A1>: Way to go, <A4>!

[caption #2097]
<A4>: I got to know the gal who brought us tea.
After a while, she just blurted out the whole crooked plan.

[caption #2098]
<A5>: So_you finally hit pay dirt, eh?

[caption #2099]
<A4>: Watch your mouth!
There're ladies present!
I was a perfect gentleman.

He was their finest soldier_

[caption #2102]
<A4>: We need to rethink our plans. Let's return to the airship.

[caption #2103]
<A7>: May I accompany you?

[caption #2104]
<A4>: Who're you?

[caption #2105]
<A1>: He's one of this town's citizens.

[caption #2106]
<A0>: He's descended from the Mage Warriors of yore_
I think he can be a big help.

[caption #2107]
<A7>: We must expect the Empire to flex its new-found muscle soon.

[caption #2108]
<A8>: I'm coming along, too.

[caption #2109]
<A5>: Yeah, right kid!

[caption #2110]

<A7>: The beginning of all magic_
<A0>: Those?<EOP>
<A7>: It is said that they somehow neutralized each other's power, then sealed themselves away_<EOP>
<A7>: If the 3 statues should ever be moved out of alignment, the resulting inbalance of power would_<EOP>
_rearrange the face of our planet_
<A0>: What?!

[caption #2119]
Quick! Back to the airship!!

<A0>: The island_
The world is groaning in pain_

[caption #2122]

I only know we're here_
Maybe we're the only people left alive_<EOP>
Cid: Since that day, the world's continued its slide into ruin. Animals and plants are dying_<EOP>
The few others who washed up here with us passed away of boredom and despair.

Cid: Well, unless I ask for fish,

Thanks for saving the child!

I was on lookout duty for Kefka_
But I lost my nerve_

[caption #2202]
Anyone who opposes Kefka is doomed. He uses his [Light of Judgment] from high atop his tower to burn whole towns.

[caption #2203]
I saw it! Kefka used a light beam to burn the village of Mobliz, to the east.<EOP>
Most of the adults there perished trying to save their children_

[caption #2204]
The [Serpent Trench] used to be deep under water.
Now it's above sea level.<EOP>
Some [Cult of Kefka] members have built a tower there_

[caption #2205]
Many monsters nowadays attack with [Zombie], [Petrify] and the like. Have you equipped suitable Relics?

[caption #2206]
To the east you'll find the [Serpent Trench.] Further east you'll find the village of Mobliz.<EOP>
Boy, the Light of Judgment really fried that town_

[caption #2207]
Head north on the Serpent Trench and you'll reach Nikeah. Ships still sail from there.

[caption #2208]
Heeeeee_
I've never been more frightened!

[caption #2209]
My child's inside!
Do something!

[caption #2210]
Must have irritated Kefka_

[caption #2211]
There are monsters inside! They keep petrifying everyone who goes in to help. You using suitable Relics?

[caption #2212]
We resisted Kefka, so he unleashed his Light of Judgment on us!

[caption #2213]
Hurry, or the house'll collapse!

You think a minor thing like the end of the world was gonna do me in?

All I can do now is restore your health.
Please_go back inside and save that child!!

[I'm scared_!]
[Don't worry, you're safe now.]

[caption #2228]
Did you see that tower_?

[caption #2229]
Kefka's up there, 'n he's using the power of the Statues_
He's like a god_

[caption #2230]
Everything changed on that day_

[caption #2231]
Anyone who opposes Kefka gets his or her town fried by the [Light of Judgment.]

[caption #2232]
On THAT day, debris from all over the world floated eerily to the center of this land mass, and formed that tower_

[caption #2233]
How can ya make a GP in a world like this?

[caption #2234]
When the world was ripped apart, many long-sealed monsters were released_<EOP>
Phunbaba_Doom Gaze_
And the 8 Dragons_

[caption #2235]
I saw Doom Gaze soaring through the sky!
I'd rather take an acid bath than fight that thing!

Uh? You again_?
<D>Oh, sorry. You look just like a man who was here searching for his friends_<EOP>
He said he was going north, to Tzen.

Well I'll be_
All right, make room for me!

[caption #2245]
The members of the [Cult of Kefka] live in this tower.
There's something wondrous atop it!<EOP>
You can only use magic attacks inside, so unless your magic's strong, you'll never make it to the top!

Beneath the Desert of Figaro lies an ancient castle_<EOP>
_loaded with treasure.
By the way, an old man who lives in the Weapon Shop in Narshe is looking for you_

No use talking to them. They've sold their hearts to Kefka.
All they do is mope around, thinking of him_

Almost all of the adults perished trying to save their children_

[caption #2260]
<A0>: There were only children here_ <D>
The moment I arrived, I felt needed_

Duane: You can't take <A0> away!

Please excuse him. It's just that if <A0> goes, she takes with her the very spirit of our survival_

[caption #2263]
<A0>: I don't know why these kids need me_<EOP>
But they've made me feel things I've never felt before.<EOP>
The moment I sensed this, I lost my will to fight.

[caption #2264]
<A0>: I can honestly say I don't know what's going on inside of me_<EOP>
And the more I try to understand it, the less inclined I am to fight.

[caption #2265]
Help!!! Run!!!
Phunbaba's coming!!

[caption #2266]

Wake up!
Uh, oh_here it comes!!

[caption #2268]
<A0>: I've really lost it_

As you can see, I can't be of any help to you.<EOP>
And besides, the children really need me.
[But <A0>_!]

[caption #2271]

I need to understand what's happening to me_

I'll win the Falcon from you when I whip you in a race!<EOP>
<A9>: You'd better clear outta my way!
Daryl: Big talk, buster!

Bunch of rich yokels inside_

Now I'll be able to go play at the art-lover's house again!

[caption #2680]
Every once in a while something very rare is sold here_

The house to the north belongs to Owzer. He's a collector of fine paintings.

It's in Owzer's house.

Lately I've seen a lot of carrier pigeons flying towards Maranda. Who can be sending all the letters?

The other day I read Owzer's diary. It was just laying there!

[caption #2695]
A while ago a little girl entered the art-collector's house_

[caption #2696]
T_that was a spirit!

[caption #2697]
I went up to talk to Owzer,
but he's nowhere to be found.

[caption #2698]
The world's so different now_

[caption #2699]

          Received the

<A8>: Huh?!
What are you talking about?

[caption #2719]
[Now_what was a monster doing in that picture?!]<EOP>
Owzer: It all started when I bought a stone at the Auction House.<EOP>
I took one look at it and suddenly felt I needed a portrait of Starlet.<EOP>
I asked several artists, but none could muster enough skill.<EOP>
It was then that I heard about <A8>'s amazing ability.
I brought her here, and put her to work.<EOP>
But while she was painting, that thing came along_ <D>
It must have been enticed here by that stone.

[caption #2720]
Where is the stone_?<EOP>
Owzer: The stone? <D>
Over on that bookshelf.

[caption #2721]
Owzer: Hey, not that.
That's priceless!!<EOP>

[caption #2849]
For the first time in 50 years, Ebot's Rock is above water!
Head north of town if you want to see it.

[caption #2850]
Gungho: Is that you,
<A7>?
Have you come back to hunt Hidon?

[caption #2851]
I've got <A7> on my side now, but what a monumental bag of hot air!

[caption #2852]
Gungho: He'll never change.
That's who he is!

[caption #2853]
When you were younger you hunted Hidon, the legendary monster. But you quit before you found it_

[caption #2854]
<A7>: I didn't really quit!<EOP>
It's just that, well, the monster lives only on Ebot's Rock, which has been submerged for some time.<EOP>
Gungho: You never could give me an honest answer.

[caption #2855]
Gungho: What a buffoon!!

[caption #2856]
Mayor: It's only been a year
since the world changed_
But it feels like forever.

[caption #2857]
<A8>: Yea!! We're back!<EOP>
It's like old times!

[caption #2858]
<A7>: Time to relax!
<D>Home sweet home!

[caption #2859]
<A8>: This is terrible!
Gungho's hurt!

[caption #2860]
<A7>: Gungho, wake up!

[caption #2861]
<A7>: Who did this to you?<EOP>
Gungho: It was_Hidon, the beast you and I used to hunt.
I almost had it_

[caption #2862]
Gungho: Oooh_cough, cough_

[caption #2863]
Gungho: <A7>_
Please_you must avenge me_

[caption #2864]
<A7>: You took on Hidon_?

[caption #2865]
<A8>: Gramps!
Why are you hesitating!

[caption #2866]
<A7>: Well_ <D>I spent my
youth chasing that creature.
To do it again at this age is more than I bargained for.

[caption #2867]
<A7>: Gungho_
rest easy, I'll do it for you!

[caption #2868]
<A8>: Just a minute!
You don't think you're going alone, do you?

[caption #2869]
<A7>: I spent too many years of my life hunting that thing. It is my obsession, not yours.

[caption #2870]
<A8>: But Grandpa!
This [obsession] of yours could easily slay you!<EOP>
You're my Grandfather.
I can't just sit idly by and watch you go.

[caption #2871]
<A7>: Sorry, <A8>.
I'm so grateful that you care!<EOP>
But as its name implies, the Hidon is extremely difficult to find.<EOP>
Unless I go alone, it will not show itself.

Gungho: You WHAT?!

<D>You're lying! LYING!

[caption #2894]
<A8>: No, he's not!
He really defeated Hidon.

[caption #2895]
<A7>: Ho, ho, ho!
If I didn't know better, I'd say that Hidon wasn't my only enemy!

[caption #2896]
Gungho: I don't believe this.
This has to be a joke!
<A7>: Ho, ho, ho!!<EOP>
<A7>: _by the way, how are your wounds healing, Gungho?

Let's let him be!
He's nice and_quiet_
Now, about my [wounds]_

[caption #2905]
<A8>: Wait!
First let me thank you.<EOP>
You gave Grandpa a reason to go and defeat something that had tormented him for decades!<EOP>
Even if YOU were faking, that creature meant business!

[caption #2906]
Gungho: What a granddaughter he's raised! Amazing!<EOP>
<A8>: And what a terrible actor you are!

Kefka: Such magnificent power!
You are like insects to me!

[caption #2988]
Kefka: I will exterminate everyone, and everything!

[caption #2989]
People will keep rebuilding the things you take from them!

[caption #2990]
Kefka: Then I'll destroy those too. Why do people rebuild things they know are going to be destroyed?<EOP>
Why do people cling to life when they know they can't live forever?<EOP>
Think how meaningless each of your lives is!

[caption #2991]
It's not the net result of one's life that's important!<EOP>
It's the day-to-day concerns, the personal victories, and the celebration of life_and love!

[caption #2992]
It's enough if people are able to experience the joy that each day can bring!

[caption #2993]
Kefka: And have you found your [joy], in this nearly dead world of ours?

[caption #2994]
Yes!

You are all helpless before me!

I will create a monument to non-existence!

Life will go on!
There will always be people,

I will hunt them down.
I will destroy it all!
Destroy! Destroy! Destroy!!

Gestahl: Worry not, <A10>, this is but a small price to pay for the power that will elevate our nation to greatness.<EOP>
Magic is a force beyond your comprehension.<D>
If you had accepted a Magitek infusion, you would understand.

[caption #3092]
<A10>: _Understood, my liege.

[caption #3093]
<A10>: _Please be safe.

[caption #3094]
<A0>: Assassin_so he's another bad person?

[caption #3095]
<A1>: Well__<D>
In any case, I won't let anyone hurt you. I promise.

[caption #3096]
<A3>: I've got a job to complete. Come, Interceptor.

[caption #3097]
Someone's put a bounty on my head and they've got a nasty assassin after me.<EOP>
I hear there's a martial arts master somewhere on this mountain but_I'm afraid to go in!

[caption #3098]
No visible wounds_It's like he simply dropped dead!

[caption #3099]
GAH!<EOP>
Don't sneak up on people like that!
Gonna give a guy a heart attack!

[caption #3100]
<A10>: Thanks to your cooperation, we were able to occupy this town with minimal casualties.<EOP>
Rich Man: I just feel like I betrayed everyone, though_

[caption #3101]
<A10>: Sometimes suffering is unavoidable_
Often all we can do is manage its extent.

[caption #3102]
<A10>: If the Empire had proceeded with its originally-planned armed invasion,<EOP>
countless more would have died on both sides.<EOP>
Thus, this is the optimal outcome.

[caption #3103]
Rich Man: At least the king was able to make it out before all this went down.

[caption #3104]
<A10>: The king?
King <A4> was here?

[caption #3105]
<A10>: Tell me, was he accompanied by a young woman?<EOP>
Rich Man: When is he not?<EOP>
<A10>: _

[caption #3106]
<A10>: Perhaps it would be best if I question the townspeople.<EOP>
Thank you again.

[caption #3107]
<A3>: I hear you paid off the aristocrat to take this town without a fight.<EOP>
If you're still feeling generous, I might have information on that girl you're after.

[caption #3108]
<A10>: I am not [after] her, I am merely concerned for her well-being.

[caption #3109]
<A10>: Was she here? Was she in good health?

[caption #3110]
<A10>: _Very well, take this.<EOP>
There can be more depending on the value of the information you provide.

[caption #3111]
<A3>: A girl passed through here not long ago.<EOP>
She was accompanied by the King of Figaro and a man who looked like a petty thief.<EOP>
She seemed timid and confused, however appeared to be with her companions willingly.

[caption #3112]
They left for Mount Kolts.  There may be a hidden stronghold in the mountains beyond.<EOP>
For an additional fee, I can return her to you.<EOP>
<A10>: _

[caption #3113]
<A10>: No, that won't be necessary.<EOP>
If she is truly acting of her own free will, I have no desire to have her robbed of it again.

[caption #3114]
Instead, I have a different request:<EOP>
Follow them,<D> watch after them,<D> see that she is safe,<EOP>
and make periodic reports back to me.

[caption #3115]
I take it this amount is sufficient for such a job?

[caption #3116]
<A3>: Come, Interceptor.

[caption #3117]
<A10>: I have new intel that there may be a Returner base in the Sabre Mountains.<EOP>
Gather soldiers and set up a blockade.

[caption #3118]
I must return to the front at Doma. The conflict there is escalating and I cannot be away for long.<EOP>
I trust you to manage things here in my absence.

[caption #3119]
<A10>: War does not suit you, <A0>.<EOP>
I hope you are able to escape from this, too.

[caption #3120]
<A10>: What about generals?

[caption #3121]
No? You sure?

[caption #3122]
Okay_

[caption #3123]
Keep up the good work young man. I'm sure your grandfather appreciates it.

[caption #3124]
<A10>: Take a break, soldier. You've earned it.<EOP>
Soldier: Of course! Thank you, sir!

[caption #3125]
General! Let me test my strength against you!

[caption #3126]
Ha ha, should've known I'd stand no chance against you!
Gonna have to take a breather_

[caption #3127]
The town's secure, General.

[caption #3128]
Glad I didn't have to use this on civilians_

[caption #3129]
A toast to our victory, General!

[caption #3130]
General, you're a music buff, right?<EOP>
Why don't you play us a celebratory song on the record player there?

[caption #3131]
Much better!

[caption #3132]
You're looking for a girl? You Imperials took everything from us, now you're after our women?!

[caption #3133]
Uh oh, is someone in trouble? It wasn't me!

[caption #3134]
A girl? Sorry, you're not my type.

[caption #3135]
I have nothing to sell to the likes of you!

[caption #3136]
No cheating!

[caption #3137]
Duncan's Wife: I'm sorry, I can't help you.
You see, my husband recently passed away_

[caption #3138]
<A10>: My condolences, ma'am.

[caption #3139]
Did we_?

[caption #3140]
Duncan's Wife: No_ <D>Though perhaps I would have preferred if he'd died fighting you.

[caption #3141]
You're not much older than my husband's students.
Why is this the path you chose?

[caption #3142]
<A10>: Please understand that I mean neither you nor this town any ill will.

[caption #3143]
I chose this path simply because I feared the alternative would cause even more harm.<EOP>
I'm afraid that is the only excuse I have.

[caption #3144]
Come on, General, fight serious!
You let me win that one!

[caption #3145]
<A1>: Why were you locked up like that, anyway?

[caption #3146]
<A6>: My subordinates don't trust me. They see my powers as a threat. <EOP>
Other infusion recipients lost their minds and souls to the process, so I suppose their fear is warranted.

[caption #3147]
One of them is plotting something heinous. <EOP>
My speaking out against it was all the excuse they needed to brand me a traitor. <EOP>
<A1>: Well, I won't turn on you like that. I promise.

[caption #3148]
<A6>: ...Anyway, this way leads out.
We should get moving before they realize I'm gone.

[caption #3149]
<A0>: Moogles!

[caption #3150]
They're so cute and fluffy_
I want to pet them all!! <EOP>
Banon: Ho, ho, girls will like what they like.

[caption #3151]
<A4>: Really? <D>
Because I've never seen <A0> react so strongly to <D> well <D> anything_

[caption #3152]
<A0>: I'm sorry_
Is it strange?

[caption #3153]
<A4>: No, no. I'm the one who should be sorry.
I'm just glad to see you coming out of your shell.

[caption #3154]
<A0>: It's true that I still have no strong feelings about the war, the Empire, or the Returners_ <EOP>
I come with you because I don't know what else to do.

[caption #3155]
But I hope if I'm able to talk to that Esper, things will start making sense. <EOP>
Banon: Then let's stop dilly-dallying and get to that Esper!

[caption #3156]
For example, the acclaimed opera penned by-

[caption #3157]
Huh?
I swear I heard him whisper something_<EOP>
[Please stop him_]

[caption #3158]
Kefka: NO ONE CARES!<EOP>
If they offer aid to the Returners, may as well just get rid of 'em all.<EOP>
<A10>: They're human beings, Kefka, just like you and me.
Please remember that.

[caption #3159]
What the_?<EOP>
Why even bother?

[caption #3160]

             Found 1 GP!

[caption #3161]
<A10>: I came as quickly as I could, my liege, per your summons regarding General <A6>_

[caption #3162]
Gestahl: Ah, yes, that matter.
A shame, really.

[caption #3163]
<A10>: You mean she's already_?

[caption #3164]
Gestahl: No. <D>
I received word that she escaped and embedded herself within a Returner faction.<EOP>
Whether it is as a traitor or a double agent remains to be seen.

[caption #3165]
So she's safe_

[caption #3166]
<A10>: I see_
I cannot fathom a reason for her to turn on us so abruptly_<EOP>
But acting as a spy doesn't sit well with me, either_

[caption #3167]
Gestahl: When dealing with lawless rebels, sometimes underhanded tactics are necessary, <A10>.

[caption #3168]
<A10>: As you say, sire.<EOP>
However, I would like to continue to execute my duties without resorting to such measures.<EOP>
If the matter with General <A6> is settled for now, I shall return to Doma.

[caption #3169]
Gestahl: That won't be necessary.

[caption #3170]
<A10>: My liege?

[caption #3171]
Gestahl: Doma is now under our complete control.
It fell while you were away.

[caption #3172]
<A10>: But_ how?<EOP>
For three years we have been unable to penetrate their defenses, so for it to fall so quickly_

[caption #3173]
Your Majesty, I must know how this was accomplished!

[caption #3174]
Gestahl: __

[caption #3175]
I myself am not aware of the full details, and Kefka has already left for another mission.

[caption #3176]
However, I do know that he was able to accomplish in a day what you failed to do in three years.

[caption #3177]
I have already lost a Magitek Elite and now a general to the Returners.<EOP>
I need to know that I can still rely on you, <A10>.

[caption #3178]
<A10>: Of course, my liege!
My heart beats only for my country's sake!

[caption #3179]
Gestahl: Good, good.<EOP>
You have valuable qualities that Kefka lacks. <D>
I would hate to lose you, too.

[caption #3180]
<A10>: I am humbled by your praise, Your Majesty.<EOP>
I pledge that I shall continue to live by the example I wish to set for our people.

[caption #3181]
<A0>: Even after everything we've gone through together, I still can't say I feel anything [special] for anyone here_

[caption #3182]
You said yourself that your heart can't be moved.<EOP>
Does having magic_ <D>keep you from feeling?

[caption #3183]
<A6>: __ If it does, all the better for it, I'd say.

[caption #3184]
<A0>: __

[caption #3185]
Kefka: Oh my, an Esper, a runaway puppet, and a traitor general all in one place!
This must be my lucky day!

[caption #3186]
Since you left them unattended, I helped myself to some of your soldiers, General <A6>. <D>
Hope you don't mind!<EOP>
I'm sure a few of them have a bone to pick with you for so selfishly abandoning them.

[caption #3187]
Don't let me get in your way, fellas!
Have at them!

[caption #3188]
<A2>: Wh_ What dark sorcery is this?!

[caption #3189]
A castle is the firm bedrock of its nation! It cannot move!
Preposterous!

[caption #3190]
<A4>: It's called [technology], my friend.
Perhaps you should look into it!

[caption #3191]
<A5>: Gya ha ha!
Yeah, Figaro's technology is pretty incredible!

[caption #3192]
<A10>: It is an impressive technological feat!
Surely it can be used to improve quality of life!

[caption #3193]
<A6>: Hmph_ The Empire stereotypes the Domans as luddites.<EOP>
I thought it was an exaggeration, but_

[caption #3194]
<A9>: Ha ha, I prefer to travel far above ground, thank you very much!

[caption #3195]
<A0>: Dark sorcery?
No_ I don't think this is magic_

[caption #3196]
<A1>: Yeah, who would've thought a castle could go where even a chocobo can't?!

[caption #3197]
<A11>: Castle dig! Castle go under ground like animal!

[caption #3198]
<A3>: __

[caption #3199]
<A8>: You old guys just don't understand ANYTHING, do you?

[caption #3200]
<A7>: Cyan, I thank you for not making me feel like the oldest one in the room.

[caption #3201]
<A13>: Ungaah?

[caption #3202]
<A12>: If it moves, I move with it.

[caption #3203]
Mog: What a neat way to travel, kupo!

[caption #3204]
<A2>: Ohh_ be silent!
Of course I knew it was a machine!

[caption #3205]
I was merely_ <D>caught off guard.

[caption #3206]
<A2>: Oh, this be_ merely the work of machinery_<EOP>

[caption #3207]
Speak not a word of this to anyone.

[caption #3208]
<A11>: This place feel_ <D>familiar_

[caption #3209]
<A11> know a house_
all alone and far away_

[caption #3210]
Every year animals know where to go home_<EOP>
<A11> have no home_
but still feel like need to go to that house.

[caption #3211]
Old man live there.
<A11> watch.
He say funny things like this man.<EOP>
<A11> like him.
